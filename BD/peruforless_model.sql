Along with a rich history, this five-star establishment offers a successful blend of modernity and tradition. Simple and elegant, each room is unique in shape and decoration, and many provide beautiful views of the city and the surrounding courtyard. With every luxury imaginable at your disposal, you are certain to experience contemporary comfort in this historical atmosphere.','','','','','<h2>Description</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A stay at the Monasterio will allow you to discover the charms of this hallowed colonial San Antonio Abad seminary built more than 300 years ago. The seminary is an excellent example of 17th century Andean Baroque architecture and offers a unique atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Monasterio hotel holds 4 lovely and well-maintained courtyards surrounded by colonial arcades and beautiful gardens and fountains which will transport you back to historic times while providing the comforts and quality of a modern 5-star hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As much a museum as a hotel, it has its own opulent gilded chapel and 18th century Escuela Cusque&ntilde;a art collection. The Chapel, dating from colonial times, has been restored and contains an altar and &ldquo;retables&rdquo; covered in gold leaf and paintings from the Cusque&ntilde;an School. The past is overwhelmingly present in this hotel even while you are pampered with every luxury and modern comfort. At night, the view of the stars from the Monasterio&rsquo;s courtyard, soft lighting, and sounds from the fountain are truly serene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 2 restaurants in the Monasterio hotel offering a delicious taste of the excellent Peruvian gastronomy. With its view of the main patio and intimate ambience, Restaurant Illariy never fails to charm. Its unique atmosphere and distinctive Andino-Nikkei cuisine, created by Chef Mariano Takinami, have been huge successes since inception. Restaurant El Tupay serves a delicious buffet breakfast from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. in the antique refectory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Room Amenities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rooms are impeccably decorated with an elegant combination of colonial and modern styles. Each room is exclusive varying in size and design, and many offer charming views of the colorful rooftops of Cusco or of the wonderful main courtyard. The accommodations off the first courtyard are more traditionally designed with an authentic feel. For a special treat, consider one of the two-story suites. There are 91 Deluxe Rooms, 12 Junior Suites, 3 Presidential Suites, and 2 Royal Suites. The decorations and furnishings are a tasteful combination of colonial and modern styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original architecture and design of the Monasterio have not been significantly altered, and thus the rooms reflect their origins as a home for Jesuit seminarians. The hotel has also alleviated many guests&rsquo; altitude sickness with its oxygen enrichment systems found in most of the rooms. Wireless Internet, a telephone, safe deposit box, and TV complete this hotel&rsquo;s modern amenities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hotel Services &amp; Facilities</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lobby bar</li>\r\n	<li>Restaurant</li>\r\n	<li>Relaxation massages</li>\r\n	<li>Excursions &amp; extra activities in Cusco</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n',5,1,1,0,'2014-09-08 20:44:45','2014-09-08 16:30:35',NULL),(38,NULL,1,4,'','','','sumaq-machu-picchu-hotel','Sumaq Machu Picchu Hotel','This exclusive and elegant hotel is located in the village of Aguas Calientes at the foot of Machu Picchu.

Comfort, relaxation, and elegance are the mainstays of this establishment. The design of the building reflects the masterful architecture of Machu Picchu, imitating the world-famous citadel through beautiful hotel d&eacute;cor and spectacular architecture. The hotel also prides itself in protecting the natural and social environment of the Cusco and Machu Picchu region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guests who wish to relax after an exciting day of visiting the citadel of Machu Picchu may spend time in the hotel&rsquo;s opulent Aqlla Spa. Aqlla, which in Quechua means &ldquo;chosen one,&rdquo; is an appropriate name for this luxurious center where guests can indulge in a relaxing massage, take advantage of the top-notch Andean-style sauna, and be pampered with salon services such as a manicure or pedicure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hotel also provides unique activities that guests can enjoy during their Machu Picchu vacation. For example, join a shaman (traditional spiritual healer) during a ceremony that pays homage and makes offerings to the Pachamama (Mother Earth). Or if you wish to partake in an unforgettable culinary experience, ask for a cooking lesson from a resident chef who will show you how to prepare Peru&rsquo;s most famous dish, ceviche (lime-marinated fish, seasoned with aji pepper and cilantro).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Qunuq restaurant welcomes guests to an intimate atmosphere where they can savor delicious meals prepared by one of Peru&rsquo;s top chefs, Rafael Piqueras. The highly-respected culinary master brings a 5-star modern flair to traditional Peruvian dishes. This elegant and exclusively-designed dining hall features an incredible view of the Urubamba River.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Room Amenities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sumaq Machu Picchu Hotel features 46 superior deluxe rooms, 11 junior suites, and 3 Sumaq suites. As can be expected, all rooms are incredibly spacious and equipped with all modern amenities, providing for a peaceful and comfortable space to relax after a long day of sightseeing. These include cable TV, a direct-dial telephone, electronic safe deposit box, minibar, and hair dryer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suites have amenities such as hydro-massage bathtubs and DVD player/mp3 radios. But for a truly excellent Machu Picchu hotel experience, stay at the Sumaq Suite, the hotel&rsquo;s largest accommodation which features a fireplace, an LCD flat-screen TV, and a plush king-sized bed covered with the softest high-thread-count cotton sheets. Guests staying in these sumptuous Sumaq Suite rooms may also rent a laptop during their stay.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hotel Services &amp; Facilities</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Aqlla Spa</li>\r\n	<li>Cooking lessons</li>\r\n	<li>Qunuq Restaurant</li>\r\n	<li>Suquy Caf&eacute; Bar</li>\r\n	<li>Nuna Boutique</li>\r\n	<li>Laundry service</li>\r\n	<li>Infirmary</li>\r\n	<li>Luggage transfer</li>\r\n	<li>Guest service</li>\r\n	<li>Wake-up call</li>\r\n	<li>Room service</li>\r\n	<li>Wireless Internet</li>\r\n	<li>Currency exchange</li>\r\n	<li>Mail &amp; fax service</li>\r\n	<li>Post service</li>\r\n	<li>Accommodations for disabled guests</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n',5,0,1,0,'2014-09-08 16:33:27','2014-09-08 16:33:01',NULL),(39,NULL,1,2,'','','','andean-wings-boutique-hotel','Andean Wings Boutique Hotel','Located in a magnificent colonial house that dates back to over 300 years ago, this charming boutique hotel offers excellent services in a luxurious atmosphere.

One thing for sure, a trip to Peru is a memorable and exciting adventure. We found the people to be colorful, charming, and ever willing to share their beautiful country with strangers. Now back in Colorado, we think back to all the sights, sounds and tastes we enjoyed.</p>\n<p>One of our fondest memories was our meal with you at Tanta Restaurant. We have never tasted such wonderful fish prepared in so many different ways. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to meet with us and introduce us to Peru.</p>\n<p>The jungle segment at Posada Amazonas was terrific--the Ese\'ejas people and Rainforest Expeditions were gracious hosts. The Posada lodge was wonderful, but there is no way we could have prepared for the intensity and lush vegetation of the jungle. We loved the wildlife at Posada, and found the sights and sounds of the jungle exhilarating.</p>\n<p>We loved the Nazca adventure, and seeing the geo-glyphs from the six-seater Cessna was great. As was the boat ride to see all the marine and bird life at Ballestas Islands. The Uros and Taquile communities on Lake Titicaca were also so interesting to visit, and the residents there were such a delight.</p>\n<p><strong>Cusco and Machu Picchu were certainly the highlights of our trip. Even though we read books and have seen documentaries of the Inca Ruins, nothing prepared us for the immensity, lushness, and location of the ruin. Seeing the ruin as the morning mist cleared was so memorable.</strong></p>\n<p>We felt fortunate that our Sacred Valley tour was on a Sunday, as both the Pisac and Chinceros Indian Markets were in full swing. We loved the textiles, alpaca sweaters, and crafts. Additionally, the ruins of Sacsayhuaman and Ollantaytambo are not to be missed.</p>\n<p>PeruRail provided excellent service, and the trains were well maintained and comfortable. The scenery along both the Machu Picchu and Cusco to Puno routes was outstanding--following along the rush and roar of the Urubamba River as we descended toward Machu Picchu from Cusco was great, as well as the views of the Andes with large flocks of llama and alpaca en route to Puno.</p>\n<p>Again, <strong>thank you for assisting us while in Peru, and for making the arrangements necessary for a memorable trip.</strong> All of the agents and guides were knowledgeable, courteous, and very helpful.

We \r\nwandered around the town visiting the market, witnessed a wedding, and in \r\nthe afternoon we followed the crowds and got to the Bullring. We watched several \r\nMatadors with the bulls, and young men trying to ride bareback on wild \r\nhorses. We used the local Tricycle-Taxis back to the hotel: an unusual ride that \r\ncost 2 soles. We saw a little bit of real Peru in this area. That night a brass \r\nband visited our hotel, and a party took place. We also had our first Pisco Sour \r\nhere... we liked this drink, and had several more during our travels.</p>\r\n<p>Machu Pichu. The ruins and the setting were breathtaking. You need \r\nlonger than the 2 hour guided tour to fully appreciate them and we are glad we \r\ncould stay longer.

The scenery on the trip \r\nwas different from what we had seen in other parts of Peru and was well \r\nexplained by the guide. We picked a good day to visit the canyon, within 10 \r\nminutes of arriving we saw our first Condor, in the next hour we had 15 /20 \r\nsightings and twice a Condor flew over our heads only a few feet above us.</p>\r\n<p>We should end by thanking you for your efforts in helping us plan the trip. \r\nThe extra night in the Sacred Valley was a stroke of genius or luck, either way, \r\nwe loved that hotel and the day in Urubamba was one of those days that just \r\nhappen, you canâ??t plan them!

It was a pleasure having Peru for Less coordinate our travel arrangements. Your representatives were always on time and very courteous and accommodating. A few things stand out that I would like to share with you. Upon arriving at the Tupac Yupanqui hotel in Cusco, I noticed that there was a curb that blocked entry for my wheelchair into the hotel. The hotel employees immediately made accommodations by lifting me, along with my chair, over the curb and into the lobby. Upon returning to the hotel later in the day from a tour of the Sacred Valley, to my surprise a ramp had been constructed making my entry into the hotel much easier. Two days later after going up to Machu Picchu, we returned once again to the Tupac Yupanqui hotel in Cusco only to discover that another two ramps had been built, one to provide access from the sidewalk, the other for access up the street curb. As a result, I had independent wheelchair access into the hotel. The train ride was an enjoyable experience. As I arrived to board the train For Machu Picchu, it became apparent that there was no wheelchair access directly onto the train. The employees of Peru Rail immediately offered their services to help me board. Fortunately I was able to hold onto handrails and climb up the stairs as my wheelchair was lifted in behind me. Once inside the train car, a young lady Ã¢â?¬ÂstewardessÃ¢â?¬Â named Cristina greeted us and provided her assistance. Throughout the trip, she went out of her way to accommodate my friends and me, and to make our trip most comfortable and memorable. Soon after we arrived at Aguas Calientes, your representative introduced me to a man who offered to assist me in navigating the trails of Machu Picchu.  Another man (a policeman) also offered to help out. As a result, my wheelchair and I were maneuvered up and down the steps and along the paths throughout the ruins. When my traveling companions met up with me, they said that I saw nearly as much of Machu Picchu as they did on their tour. What an adventure that was. After returning to Cusco from Machu Picchu, I discovered that some parts from my wheelchair were missing. We phoned your company asking for your driver to look for them in the van. To my surprise he found them and promptly returned the parts to me at our hotel. For this kind act, I am very grateful.

Yet your representative and driver were there waiting for us (I must say I was very pleasantly surprised). That set the tone for the entire trip- no matter what delays we ran into, the representatives were there awaiting us. As we found out when talking to other travellers who had booked with different companies, this is not a given; many of them were not picked up when their arrival was delayed. All the representatives were very courteous and helpful and went out of their way to make our trip pleasant. The guides were superb; every single one of them showed a passion for their work: they wanted us to get to know Peru and to appreciate its rich heritage and culture. And they were all very well informed and loved to share their knowledge. The whole itinerary was great, just the right balance between sightseeing and some free time. I particularly liked the idea that we were able to customize- I think that is a really great plus of your program.

Ale coordinated most of our trip and after a few weeks of emails and suggestions from Ale and changed itineraries we finalized our plans. <strong>We had planned to do all the bookings ourselves to save money as we have done this in other continents such as Europe and Asia without problems. But, we soon learned that South America is very different and we worked out that it was going to be a lot less stressful and most probably cheaper to book it through your services. This certainly turned out to be true.</strong> In Chile & Bolivia we had made our own direct bookings. However, flights were cancelled, taxis were very expensive, and roads were blocked. This meant a lot of uncertainly and wasted time, with organizing new flights and rearranging hotel bookings etc. We had enough adventure by the time we arrived in Peru. It was such a relief knowing that everything had been organized by this time. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our whole trip in Peru was fantastic.</strong> It is such a diverse place and it was hard to say what impressed us the most - it was a combination of the scenery, history, culture, and the food!! On the whole, we like to do our own thing so your service was ideal for us. <strong>With just over three week\'s holiday, it was so good to arrive at a place knowing we would be picked up and taken to our hotel which was already booked.</strong> Not having to waste so much time finding suitable accommodation or haggle prices with the hotels or taxis, meant we had heaps of extra time to just relax and explore. We would be picked up from the bus or train and taken to our hotel where all our tickets were waiting for us. We had pre-arranged mini-tours and were then left to our own devices for a day or so, depending on where we were. The longer tours were very small in number which was great. You were not stuck with the same group for a traditional tour. If there were any changes to the itinerary we were called at the hotel or messages were left for us to advise of any time changes. At every place, we were allocated a person to whom we could call for any problems. Also, there was an emergency contact if something went astray. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highlights of the Peru trip were of course Machu Picchu, Colca Canyon, Lake Titicaca, and Paracas/Nazca.

Overall, it was hard to say what was the best and everywhere the guides were so good. <strong>Fabricio went out of his way to make our first view of Machu Picchu incredibly special.</strong> Your website is fantastic to go and check out the suggested itineraries and look at the hotels.

And when there was a change in a tour meeting time, at least four staff members of the Hotel Arqueologo informed us of the new time.</p> \r\n<p><strong>Machu Picchu: Our guide Fabricio was a wonderfully kind and knowledgeable man who enabled us both to enjoy this magnificent wonder.</strong> He was so encouraging and thoughtful as he helped a 60 something woman trek though the ruins. Because he focused on her safety and enjoyment, it allowed her younger companion to thoroughly enjoy the ruins at her own pace. Just as amazing to us was the friendly welcome and assistance we received from the people of Peru who were not associated with PFL: the staff of the left luggage office at the Lima airport; the vendors in the craft markets; the proprietress of the corner store where we purchased bottled water; the waiters at the restaurants; and many, many others. </p>\r\n<p>We cannot thank you enough for our amazing adventure in Peru!!

Too many things could go wrong as we tall Americans stand out so easily in just dealing with security just as a starter and having a multitude of staff representatives meeting us at airports and train stations, supervising next day\'s tours with special planning meetings and in hosting us with private drivers daily along with private tour guides who all spoke English fluently. All of our friends were particularly scared to death that we were going to San Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. But your Rio de Janeiro representative quickly settled that issue ten minutes after checking in at the hotel. He succinctly gave us specific do\'s and don\'ts and we were completely safe during all of our free time as we freely walked, eat (never got sick) and shopped all over both day and night as the fashions in Rio are trend setting. And above all, Peru for Less gave us the best customization possible in making the itinerary so dynamic and fulfilling and all within a minimum amount of visitation time in each city and country. Our trip was incredibly successful in three different countries: Chile, Brazil and Peru. And in every instance, the coordination of details and execution were impeccably accurate regardless of the country visited. Success at every stage was achieved regardless of location, the weather, the country and/or the time of day or night we traveled and were sight-seeing.

I loved seeing the condors in flight. Our guide, Edwin, did a great job of stopping along the way to point out the interesting things.  </p>\r\n  \r\n<p>Flying the Nazca lines was wonderful. We enjoyed all the sites and particularly enjoyed the guide provided there--Paul.  He\'s also the guy that took us to the Ballestas Islands.  He had a great personality and provided accurate details. The Ballestas Islands were great too. Seeing all those animals was certainly fun. I had a Wildlife Guide, and everywhere I went guides helped me to mark the wildlife I saw. It was nice to know I had a good book, but it was even nicer that all the people helped me to identify animals.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We enjoyed our day in Lima too. Edgar did a great job of taking us to places that were important to us. For example, I was trying to find a particular book for my nephew.  Edgar took me to several places until we found the book, I really appreciated it.  Orlando was also a wonderful perk to the trip. He was the owner of La Casa Bella.  The services provided on our last night/day almost made us want to stay longer.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>I loved the country, I loved the experience, and I was certainly happy with your company. I hope the thoughts I\'ve shared in this letter convey that. We do appreciate the security traveling with Peru For Less gave us.

Our tour guide Fabricio was very warm and friendly, \r\nand helpful to those in our party who needed an extra hand with the \r\nrigorous climb up and down the inclines of Machu Picchu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fabricio was able to arrange an escort for my daughter to climb \r\nWaynapicchu, which made her very happy, and was a great relief to me. \r\nGabriela was especially delighted to be the first in line for the 7 AM \r\nclimb, thanks to the advocacy and dedication of both Fabricio and Mary, \r\nin Agua Calientes and on the mountain. The Wayna Picchu staff marked her \r\nticket with a number 1, which is a great souvenir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to say that before meeting the staff, I had my concerns about  \r\narranging for a tour online without any direct contact beforehand. Once \r\nthe trip began, however, it was apparent that Peru for Less has a real \r\ndedication to making sure that travelers experience a worry free and \r\npleasant trip. Every transfer, arrangement, contact and tour was \r\nhandled professionally, efficiently, and with great communication. We \r\nalways had an emergency phone number to contact Christina in Cusco if \r\nwe ran into trouble or needed something, and at all times felt well \r\ncared for and  secure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will definitely recommend Peru for Less to everyone I know who is \r\nconsidering a trip to Peru, and I will begin planning my next Peru for \r\nLess expedition as soon as possible!!

It wasn\'t actually our honeymoon; it was more of a trip just for fun. All of the guides we had on each part of our trip were fantastic. Everyone was very friendly and knowledgable. Overall I guess that the hotels were what someone should expect for a 3 star hotel. The woman we had contact with in Cuzco was great, I can\'t seem to remember her name at the moment.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Here are some things I would recommend to others traveling to Peru: \r\nIn hindsight I think that we would have done things just a little differently, such as having 1 extra day in either Cuzco or Aguas Calientes just to unwind a little bit. Also I think we would have done the 5 day trek because we heard really good things about it (not that we didn\'t enjoy the Lares trek). Another thing I think I would recommend to other travelers is when making your way back from Aguas Calientes to Cuzco, get off at the Ollyantambo train station and take a van back to Cuzco. </p>\r\n','Ben. \r\nMinneapolis, USA <br/>\r\nLares Trek and Amazon\r\n','ben.jpg','ben','',596,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(307,1,'Hello Rylee,','<p>Peru was very fine.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Our pick- ups from train station or the airport were always on schedule. In Cuzco, we stayed at a very nice hotel, the Arquelogo. It had a very nice staff and was very clean. We had a beautiful experience. We had a nice hotel and a very good guide just for the two of us. This is excellent because, because chasing monkeys with 20 people is a lot more difficult. The macaws and all the other animals were an experience we will never forget. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>For our Sacred Valley tour, we thought that Ollantaytambo is very impressive and the market of Pisac is nice. \r\nThe Lares trek was very nice. We liked every part of it. We had a very good guide, a good cook and a good tent (even after the hail storm).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So to conclude, we had a very nice experience and we saw a lot of beautiful things (I think we don\'t yet realise half of it). \r\nThank you for organising everything, </p>\r\n','Sarah and Bart\r\nOostende, Belgium <br/>\r\nLares Trek, Cuzco, Machu Picchu and Lake Sandoval in Puerto Maldonado \r\n','sarah-bart.jpg','Sarah and Bart','',597,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(308,1,'Dear Peru For Less','<p>Yes our trip was a \"once in a lifetime experience\" Machu Picchu was on my \"Bucket List\" as a place to visit before I die.

Please pass this on to her supervisor. Everyone along the way that represented Peru for Less did a fine job. Our tours were well planned and our guides did a fine job.

The success of our trip was mainly due to the planning that we made together. Without your assistance and advice, it would have been completely a different experience. The hotels we picked were very good and in most cases surpassed our expectations. Not only were they comfortable, the people were very hospitable and courteous.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>LIMA - We had a very comfortable stay in Lima. Our guide in Lima, a young man named Miguel, was very knowledgeable and friendly. Not only did he show us the sights in Lima, he also gave us suggestions for shopping and suggested a good dinner restaurant  called \"Junius\". At Junius, we enjoyed an elegant meal and were entertained with a live band and show where we were treated to Peruvian dances and music.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>CUZCO - Our flight to Cuzco was delayed by weather. This was the hardest day of our entire trip. We left the hotel at 3.30am. Our hotel staff at Lima, woke us up in time and graciously provided us breakfast before we left. However our 6.00 am flight was cancelled because of the weather in Cuzco. We did not leave Lima until 2.45 pm, reaching Cuzco just before sunset. Ms. Pamela picked us and dropped us off at the airport.\r\nAfter arrival, we were told of the strike situation in Cuzco and realized that we would have another delay in getting to Ollantaytambo. Ms. Christine in Cuzco was very efficient and concerned to make sure we got to our destination safely. We left Cuzco for Ollantaytambo around 8 pm presuming that the strike was over and it was safe to go. However, on the way we encountered one obstacle after another in a never-ending series that made our 2 hr journey to Sacred Valley into a 6 hr ordeal, finally arriving there at 2 am. Dealing with an angry mob and not knowing what lay ahead kept us in constant worry about our safety. Our driver Mr. Mario deserves more than what we can describe in words. He went above and beyond his duty in order to keep us safe and out of harms way. Mario took us into a safe side street until the violence of the mob subsided, and then ventured cautiously ahead.\r\nBoth he and Christine kept in close touch till the wee hours of the morning in making sure that we were safe and got to our destination unscathed.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>OLLANTAYTAMBO/MACHU PICCHU - Our hotel in Ollantaytambo was very picturesque, nestled in the valley and beautifully landscaped. Unfortunately, we did not have time to savor its beauty as we were taking the early morning train to Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu was breathtaking, and our hotel \"Inkaterra Pueblo Hotel\" was the highlight of our stay in Peru. Although a bit expensive, I\'d recommend that hotel to anyone who would like to just relax and enjoy splendor and beauty of their property. The hotel offers activities like nature walks, bird watching, orchid garden tour and other educational tours included, at no extra charge. Their food was beyond excellent with Breakfast, Lunch, High Tea and Dinner. Their service was impeccable. We had a wonderful time there we feel our stay there was memorable and well worth it. The Inkaterra  Hotel is in a class by itself.\r\nOur train ride back to Cuzco was leisurely and we enjoyed the scenic beauty of the Valley and the Urubamba River.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>CUZCO/SACRED VALLEY - After a restful night, we met our Guide - Maria Elena Amanca Flores. By far, Maria gets the distinction of being the BEST GUIDE on our PERU/ECUADOR trip. She is not only very knowledgeable about the history and culture of the Peruvian people, she is also a very kind hearted person. She was always attentive to our needs, and treated us like her own family member. We do not think of her as a guide, but more as a good friend. We would welcome another trip to Cuzco and spend more time in this wonderful city as our present stay was very short. I am sure Maria would make it enjoyable for us the next time and we will look forward to it. Once again I have to thank you and Peru for less for arranging the Sacred Valley tour and the sights around Cuzco tours, together. Ordinarily we would have missed the tour due to the strike.  It was a long day for all of us, but very enjoyable, and we had a great time.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>QUITO - Our trip from Cuzco - Lima - Quito was good. The hotel and food in Quito was good. Quito is a great city. Our guide at the Equatorial monument was a young lady who was also very pleasant. Our Quito guide was a young man who was knowledgeable and helpful. He is also an avid trekker.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>GALAPAGOS - We enjoyed our five days cruising around the Galapagos Islands. Our yacht \"Estrella del Mar\" was a comfortable boat. Fortunately, the waters were not too choppy. The Captain and crew were very nice and always there to help and assist the passengers. Food was great and adequate and no food was wasted. I have to make a special mention of their soups. They were wonderful and out of this world.\r\nOur guide Naturalist guide Estebhan Chavez was excellent.  As we are not swimmers, we did miss out the natural beauty that comes with snorkeling and diving. My husband was happily taking all the pictures and videos he could in this natural oasis. I have not yet checked them out.\r\nOur last day on land, in the Galapagos was leisurely and helped us unwind. We flew back to Quito to return back to the US, happy to be home and yet nostalgic with wonderful memories of the past 2 weeks to carry us through.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>All in all, we had a great time. Our holiday was enjoyable beyond our expectations. We enjoyed Peru much more than Ecuador/Galapagos. We would love to visit this beautiful country Peru again. Not only is the natural scenery exquisite, the Inca history and its civilization has enamored us. But most of all, our memories are cherished by the warmth of the people, their simplicity, honesty, good nature and hard work. \r\nI thank you once again for all the coordination and hard work to put everything in order for us. I can categorically state that it is with your help Chris, and the assistance of the others who work with \'Peru for Less \' our trip was so incredibly enjoyable. You certainly helped a lot in coordinating before and during our trip as unforeseen circumstances required changes that became necessary. We would love to repeat the experience again to visit other places in Peru and South America. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed working with you and will happily recommend you and \"Peru for Less\" to my friends and associates for their future travel to South America.</p>\r\n','Thanks once again.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nShirley &amp; Noel <br/>\r\nCuzco, Machu Picchu, Gal&aacute;pagos\r\n','dias-shirley.jpg','Shirley &amp; Noel Dias','',599,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(310,1,'Dear Peru For Less','<p>Forgive us for not having communicated with you earlier.

The success of our trip was mainly due to the planning that we made together. Without your assistance and advice, it would have been completely a different experience. The hotels we picked were very good and in most cases surpassed our expectations. Not only were they comfortable, the people were very hospitable and courteous.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>LIMA - We had a very comfortable stay in Lima. Our guide in Lima, a young man named Miguel, was very knowledgeable and friendly. Not only did he show us the sights in Lima, he also gave us suggestions for shopping and suggested a good dinner restaurant  called Junius. At Junius, we enjoyed an elegant meal and were entertained with a live band and show where we were treated to Peruvian dances and music.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>CUZCO - Our flight to Cuzco was delayed by weather. This was the hardest day of our entire trip. We left the hotel at 3.30am. Our hotel staff at Lima, woke us up in time and graciously provided us breakfast before we left. However our 6.00 am flight was cancelled because of the weather in Cuzco. We did not leave Lima until 2.45 pm, reaching Cuzco just before sunset. Ms. Pamela picked us and dropped us off at the airport.\r\nAfter arrival, we were told of the strike situation in Cuzco and realized that we would have another delay in getting to Ollantaytambo. Ms. Cristine in Cuzco was very efficient and concerned to make sure we got to our destination safely. We left Cuzco for Ollantaytambo around 8 pm presuming that the strike was over and it was safe to go. However, on the way we encountered one obstacle after another in a never-ending series that made our 2 hr journey to Sacred Valley into a 6 hr ordeal, finally arriving there at 2 am. Dealing with an angry mob and not knowing what lay ahead kept us in constant worry about our safety. Our driver Mr. Mario deserves more than what we can describe in words. He went above and beyond his duty in order to keep us safe and out of harms way. Mario took us into a safe side street until the violence of the mob subsided, and then ventured cautiously ahead.\r\nBoth he and Christine kept in close touch till the wee hours of the morning in making sure that we were safe and got to our destination unscathed.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>OLLANTAYTAMBO/MACHU PICCHU - Our hotel in Ollantaytambo was very picturesque, nestled in the valley and beautifully landscaped. Unfortunately, we did not have time to savor its beauty as we were taking the early morning train to Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu was breathtaking, and our hotel \"Inkaterra Pueblo Hotel\" was the highlight of our stay in Peru. Although a bit expensive, I\'d recommend that hotel to anyone who would like to just relax and enjoy splendor and beauty of their property. The hotel offers activities like nature walks, bird watching, orchid garden tour and other educational tours included, at no extra charge. Their food was beyond excellent with Breakfast, Lunch, High Tea and Dinner. Their service was impeccable. We had a wonderful time there we feel our stay there was memorable and well worth it. The Inkaterra  Hotel is in a class by itself.\r\nOur train ride back to Cuzco was leisurely and we enjoyed the scenic beauty of the Valley and the Urubamba River.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>CUZCO/SACRED VALLEY - After a restful night, we met our Guide - Maria Elena Amanca Flores. By far, Maria gets the distinction of being the BEST GUIDE on our PERU/ECUADOR trip. She is not only very knowledgeable about the history and culture of the Peruvian people, she is also a very kind hearted person. She was always attentive to our needs, and treated us like her own family member. We do not think of her as a guide, but more as a good friend. We would welcome another trip to Cuzco and spend more time in this wonderful city as our present stay was very short. I am sure Maria would make it enjoyable for us the next time and we will look forward to it. Once again I have to thank you and Peru for less for arranging the Sacred Valley tour and the sights around Cuzco tours, together. Ordinarily we would have missed the tour due to the strike.  It was a long day for all of us, but very enjoyable, and we had a great time.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>QUITO - Our trip from Cuzco - Lima - Quito was good. The hotel and food in Quito was good. Quito is a great city. Our guide at the Equatorial monument was a young lady who was also very pleasant. Our Quito guide was a young man who was knowledgeable and helpful. He is also an avid trekker.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>GALAPAGOS - We enjoyed our five days cruising around the Galapagos Islands. Our yacht \"Estrella del Mar\" was a comfortable boat. Fortunately, the waters were not too choppy. The Captain and crew were very nice and always there to help and assist the passengers. Food was great and adequate and no food was wasted. I have to make a special mention of their soups. They were wonderful and out of this world.\r\nOur guide Naturalist guide Estebhan Chavez was excellent.  As we are not swimmers, we did miss out the natural beauty that comes with snorkeling and diving. My husband was happily taking all the pictures and videos he could in this natural oasis. I have not yet checked them out.\r\nOur last day on land, in the Galapagos was leisurely and helped us unwind. We flew back to Quito to return back to the US, happy to be home and yet nostalgic with wonderful memories of the past 2 weeks to carry us through.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>All in all, we had a great time. Our holiday was enjoyable beyond our expectations. We enjoyed Peru much more than Ecuador/Galapagos. We would love to visit this beautiful country Peru again. Not only is the natural scenery exquisite, the Inca history and its civilization has enamored us. But most of all, our memories are cherished by the warmth of the people, their simplicity, honesty, good nature and hard work. \r\nI thank you once again for all the coordination and hard work to put everything in order for us. I can categorically state that it is with your help Chris, and the assistance of the others who work with \'Peru for Less \' our trip was so incredibly enjoyable. You certainly helped a lot in coordinating before and during our trip as unforeseen circumstances required changes that became necessary. We would love to repeat the experience again to visit other places in Peru and South America. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed working with you and will happily recommend you and \"Peru for Less\" to my friends and associates for their future travel to South America.</p>\r\n','Thanks once again.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nShirley &amp; Noel <br/>\r\nSaint Joseph, Missouri <br/>\r\nCuzco, Machu Picchu, Galapagos \r\n','','','',119,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(324,1,'Dear Peru For Less','<p>Hi Aimee...This trip really was a once in a lifetime experience. We enjoyed every minute of it!</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>We just loved the hotel in Cusco - the Casa San Blas. It was so cute and cozy and everyone was so nice and helpful. We just had a short walk downhill to reach the main plaza and shopping and restaurants.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Our drivers were all great. All the people from Peru For Less were wonderful - especially Veronica in Puno and Christina in Cusco. I think Christina deserves a medal and time off for all the time she put in over the problems due to the strike. I hope that you will pass along to her office how great we thought she was. Our guides were just as wonderful - Bruno in Puno, Rosa in Lima, Fabrizio in Machu Picchu, Antonio and Juan Carlos in Cusco. They were all very knowledgeable and easy to get along with.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The bus ride from Lima to Nazca was way better than we had hoped. I have never been on a bus where you could lay the seat back and nap if you wanted (not that we wanted to nap - too much to see!!!!) - or where you were served meals by a bus attendant. The ride went by so quickly! The flight over the Nazca Lines was phenomenal and we really enjoyed it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In Puno I was affected by the altitude on the first evening and early the next morning but by the time we were out visiting the floating islands in Uros, I was doing much better. I just kept drinking coca tea and eating coca candies. Denis luckily wasn\'t affected at all. I didn\'t realize that I was going to be walking uphill for so far on the island of Taquile to get to the top for lunch, but I\'m proud to say that I made it and also survived the walk down the other side of the hill. It was another great day - we felt we were in the midst of a National Geographic special.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The city of Cuzco was my favorite place and I\'m glad we got to spend a few days there. Unfortunately it rained most of the time that we were up at Machu Pichhu but that really didn\'t make a difference. It was still a magical place. Apart from the ruins, being in the midst of the jungle-covered Andes was so impressive to me. I couldn\'t stop looking up at the mountains. We were glad we had the chance to take the van back to Cuzco from Ollantaytambo instead of the train because it was such a scenic trip by van up to the top of a mountain and then back down into the valley. I know the strike caused you and your co-workers more work than you needed but for us everything ran so smoothly.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>Our final tour along the Sacred Valley was also a beautiful trip. We scrambled to the top of the ruins at Ollantaytambo and trooped through the market at Pisac and enjoyed every minute of it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The food was delicious everywhere we went and we tried to taste a lot of the Peruvian specials. I am hooked on Pisco Sours and we brought home 2 bottles of Pisco so we can make some here.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>All in all, we can\'t say enough good things about all our drivers, aides, guides and tours. We took over 650 pictures so we\'ll never forget a minute of the trip.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As a home-based travel agent myself I know I will definitely come back to Peru For Less if I have customers who want to travel to Peru. It\'s nice to know that there is such a reliable travel company out there, as we did hear a few horror stories from other travellers about the companies they were dealing with.\r\n \r\n<p>Again, thank you for all the help and the super-enjoyable holiday.

I found this to be the case throughout our contact with Peruvians everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boat ride from Puerto Maldonado to Refugio Amazonas took about 2 1/2 hours.  We had around a dozen people on board.  They prepared a unique lunch wrapped in banana leaves.  It was some rice based concoction and very good.  The boat ride to Tambopata took about 4 hours including 2 stops at ranger stations as we entered the refuge.  The boats were handled professionally and safely.  All locals on the boat were good people.  We were surprised at how shallow the river is.  They had to poll in certain areas on the way from Refugio Amazonas to Tambopata.  This was not the rainy season.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our specific guide - \"William\" - was on time, very pleasant, hard working, knowledgeable and fun.  He was incredibly patient and helpful as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest surprise was the \"clay lick\".  We got up at 4:30am to get to the hillside across from what is touted as the world\'s largest clay lick for macaws and parrots of every variety.  Little by little, the parrots flew to different perches as dawn approached.  You could hear the sounds of dozens of parrots more than you could see them.  About the time the sun was barely on the horizon - what we call magic time in the film business - it was like someone pulled a lever and the sky exploded with parrots.  I have never seen anything like it.  The sun was shining on their underbellies reflecting the incredible colors of their feathers.  Parrots were flocking in large numbers coming out of everywhere.  The sound was almost deafening.  This explosion of birds went on for at least 45 minutes.  You have to understand that in all my travels to tropical places, I have never seen more than 2 macaws in one place and they were not in the wild.  I wish I could have gotten a closer look at the flocks but they were moving so fast it was hard to keep them in the lens finder.  It was truly a mind blowing morning.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found Peru For Less to be exemplary in their administration, communication and planning.  </p>\r\n','Good work.\r\n\r\nJohn <br/>\r\nAustin, TX\r\nTambopata Research Center','bernardoni.jpg','bernardoni','',626,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(351,1,'Dear Peru For Less','<p>Am just writing to let you know that my friends and I had a marvelous time in Peru!

It was so nice to be greeted by friendly people on arrival in a new place and not to have to worry about hotels. We also appreciated to have the phone numbers of the different people who looked after us, just in case. We never needed them!\r\nThe tours were in small groups. The tour guides were extremely knowledgeable and proud of their country. We learned a lot about history, plants, animals and customs. The tours offered by Peru for Less are well chosen to explore different climates, geography and cultures of the country.\r\nAlexander, our guide from Puno, was also superb. He took us to an Uros Island further from Puno, so there were no other tours there. On Amantani he made sure everybody was comfortable with their host family. At Taquile he landed in a non touristy spot, took us through farmers fields to the ridge on the island and we ended up at a secluded sandy beach, where some of us played ball with local youth. We had an introduction to soap making from a herb and the significance of the belts that the men wear. We finished with a most delicious trout meal. We really appreciated that Alexander knew how to bring us away from touristy places and closer to the people.\r\nThe highlights for us were Machu Picchu, the home stay at Amantani Island and the days in the jungle.</p>\r\n','Thanks again for always being there for us.\r\n\r\nVerena and Bill\r\nOttawa, Canada\r\nLima, Puerto Maldonado, Cuzco, Puno, Arequipa, Nazca, and Ica','verena.jpg','verena','',628,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(353,1,'Dear Peru For Less','<p>As an experienced single traveler, I usually make my own travel arrangements including local tours.  However, Peru seemed a bit challenging as it would involve three cities, five different hotel stays, travel by planes, trains, taxis and buses, and tours desired at each location. Based on what was offered on their WEB site, I selected Peru for Less and was very glad I did. The entire trip went off without a single hitch. There was someone to meet me with a sign stating my name at all the airports, and train stations. Before each departure a Peru for Less representative waited with me for the local tour operator to pick me up.  The tour agents in Lima , Juan Pablo and Daniel Smith set up the entire tour flawlessly.  Their field representative in Cusco was a very personable and likeable young lady named Kari. She was simply amazing. I was continually impressed by her intrinsic enthusiasm and commitment to my having the easiest and best trip ever. Kari even printed out my plane boarding passes, walked me through the tax and ticket lines and carried one of my bags. You can\'t beat that for service. The hotel in Cusco, Picoaga was a former mansion with an inner courtyard complete with fountain. The rooms were immaculate, quiet and furnished in a Peruvian colonial style but with all the modern amenities. Unless you want to pay a small fortune, there are on very few hotels in Las Aguas Calientes also known as the Machu Picchu town that are up to American standards. I stayed at the Orquideas Hotel. The price was reasonable by Las Aguas Calientes prices and although it was simple, it was clean and quiet with a staff that would consistently go out of its way to ensure that your stay was an pleasant one. The tours \r\n(Cusco, Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu) were very enjoyable with informed, English speaking guides. I am returning to South America next year and Peru for Less would be my Travel Agency of choice.

Peru For Less did everything they said they would and always on time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the planning phase, I e-mailed and talked to Kristina many times. Each time, she answered my questions and followed up later whenever she said she would. She made suggestions for hotels (Ramada in Lima) and (Del Prado Inn in Cuzco) which I accepted and with which we were fully satisfied. She listened to me when I outlined what we wanted to do and how much time we had. Our time was short at my son\'s request as he had to get back to his job. She responded with a custom tour with certain options. Within a day or two, we worked out the details and finalized things. When she said she would reply back with an answer or an option within one day, she did just that. When I am hiring someone, I expect good service and Kristina delivered every time. There were no surprises when we arrived. I am totally pleased with Kristina\'s service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allison met us at the airport upon our arrival in Cuzco and was very friendly and courteous. She picked us up the next morning for Machu Picchu and again the final morning to go to the airport. Each time she provided very complete answers to our questions and even put up with my poor Spanish. Upon arrival at out hotel, she escorted us in and told the hotel worker who we were and helped get us initially settled. At the airport, she went in with us and took us through baggage check and the airport tax counter. She had also printed our boarding passes for this Cuzco-Lima flight. The morning of the train ride to Machu Picchu, she escorted us into the train station and made sure we had all our tickets for the train and for Machu Picchu. She left only when we assured her we knew where the line was for the train. Escorting us in these situations reduced the stress of guessing things or figuring them out as we went along. A nice touch. My main concern after arrival was that one of our transfers would be late or not show up at all. You know what that would do to our trip.

A summary of the trip would have to be that it was just wonderful.  I can\'t tell you how impressed we were about how smoothly everything went and what an incredible standard of care we received from the Peru for Less employees and agents in each town.  I would say that the trip and all the transport went off without a single hitch and the whole experience was so much more than we had even dared to hope.  A big thank you to you and the team for such a great experience.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Our tour in Lima was good: the guide was knowledgeable and spoke very good English.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In Ica someone was waiting for us at the bus station, even though were over an hour late.  The Mossone Hotel in Haucachina is amazing - the whole building was lovely. We had a fun day on the dune buggies and went sandboarding.  We ran into Omar, who had collected us from the airport and was with another tour group - when we came to collect our luggage he had left some chocolates for us with the hotel!  Please thank him for his kindness and tell him they were delicious.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Hotel Oro Viejo in Nazca was also extremely nice.  The staff was very accommodating; we didn\'t leave until 9:30pm and they were very happy for us to wander in and out and use the very nice pool and common area all day, even after we had checked out.  The Nazca Lines overflight was very good - we went in the morning and as there was no wind it was smooth.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The night bus to Arequipa was amazing, just like first class air travel.  Casa Andina is nice and provided very good breakfast.  The tour was good and the highlight was the Santa Catalina Monastery, which was beautiful.  The Colca Canyon Tour was was a magical experience.  We saw vicunas on the way, which we were very pleased about.  We also visited the hot springs, which we enjoyed very much. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>When we arrived in Cuzco we were picked up at the airport by Christina, who was just amazing.  She gave us such a lot of information it was almost overwhelming. She drew maps, recommended places to eat and things to see, and gave us tips on visiting Machu Picchu. We did the tour of the city with Juan Carlos, who was just an incredible guide - very knowledgeable and full of interesting insight.  We also did the Sacred Valley tour with him the next day and were very impressed with him.  We took the bus to visit Pisac were very impressed by the ruins. By going on our own we got to spend as much time as we wanted there and really explore and the bus trip was an adventure.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>When we were in Machu Picchu it was great fun hiking up all the steps of Wayna Picchu in the dark with lots of little flashlights bobbing.  We did the 7am hike up the mountain and it was very quiet as we stayed ahead of most of the crowds.  It was amazing and totally worth the early start. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>We had no problems at all and a great trip in general. I\'m sure we will be back to Peru at some stage - we have yet to see the Amazon.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Thanks again to you and all your team,</p>\r\n','Jon &amp; Catherine <br/>\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nLima, Ica, Nazca, Arequipa, Cuzco and Machu Picchu','','','',138,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(374,1,'Hi Rylee,','<p>We had a grand time in Peru last week.

As an\r\nexample, fifteen minutes after arriving in my hotel in Aguas Calientes\r\nafter&nbsp;the grueling three day Salcantay trek, I received a phone call from\r\nher informing me the train&nbsp;ticket for my return journey to <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Cuzco</st1:place></st1:city> the following\r\nday&nbsp;was with my guide.

I stayed at the\r\nCasa Andina both before and after my trek. The first time I had a ground floor\r\nroom, the second time an upper floor room. The best rooms are on the upper\r\nfloor. The staff at the Casa Andina were excellent and highly professional. I\r\nhad a couple of issues with the toilet and the lockable safe, which were dealt\r\nwith quickly and efficiently. I was not able to take advantage of the\r\ncomplementary dinner and folk show at the Tunupa restaurant in <st1:place w:st=\"on\">Cusco</st1:place> on Day 2, because of a very early start the next\r\nday, so&nbsp;at the conclusion of my trip, I treated myself to&nbsp;a gourmet\r\nlunch there.

All\r\nof the people affiliated with your company did a fantastic job.&nbsp; The tour\r\nguides were well organized, knowledgeable and spoke English very well. Every\r\nevening there was a message at my hotel confirming my pickup time. I really\r\nliked that. I also appreciated the fact that I had an emergency contact number\r\nin case something happened. I was traveling alone in a strange country and that\r\nwas a great comfort. Not to mention when I left Cuzco, the gal that accompanied\r\nme to the airport walked me to the ticket counter, then proceeded to escort me\r\nto the airport fee counter and then to the security screening area. A very nice\r\ntouch. I felt like a VIP!<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-US\">I would like to take this opportunity to point out two\r\nparticular people that I feel stood out.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-US\">The first person is you Chris. You were the first\r\nperson from your agency that I dealt with and you made a great first\r\nimpression. Your knowledge of your product and the fact that we were able to\r\neffectively communicate via email and/or telephone depending on the\r\ncircumstances was important to me. My work schedule can and often changes at a\r\nmoments notice so it is important for people like me to be able to have more\r\nthan one means of communicating. And your knowledge of your company\'s offerings\r\nalso made it easy to deal with you when it came to customizing my trip. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-US\">The second person who really made the trip extra\r\nspecial was Fabricio. <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Machu Picchu</st1:place></st1:city>\r\nis a spectacular place all by itself but Fabricio\'s knowledge of the Incas and\r\nthe site in particular enriched the experience all the more.&nbsp; And it was\r\nmore than his knowledge of the site but his enthusiasm and sense of pride that\r\nreally came across. On top of all of that he was very sensitive to the varying\r\nability levels of the group and adjusted his pace accordingly. When it was time\r\nto stop to explain a particular point of interest he made sure that there was\r\nsome shade and whenever possible a place to sit.&nbsp; If your goal is to\r\nexceed your customer\'s expectations you should use him as much as possible for\r\nthe <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Machu Picchu</st1:place></st1:city>\r\ntours.&nbsp; And whatever you pay him to conduct those tours, you should double\r\nit. You do not want to lose that guy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-US\">I was most surprised by <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Cuzco</st1:place></st1:city>. I had seen a couple of shows on the\r\nTravel Channel that really only gave it a few minutes and pretty much described\r\nit as a place to stop and adjust to the altitude before continuing on to Machu\r\nPicchu. But it is so much more than that and so much bigger than I expected.

They have a business center for online check-in and\r\nprinting boarding passes in order to save time also.&nbsp; And they store bags\r\nso a great place for using as a \"home base\" for travel within <st1:country-region w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Peru</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExplorama Lodge was really well organized. They greeted us at <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Iquitos</st1:place></st1:city> airport and gave excellent service at\r\nall times.&nbsp; They actually assign each group a guide who stayed with us the\r\nentire time and helps us plan our&nbsp;daily schedule around our\r\ninterests.&nbsp; Luckily for us, the weather was great.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe family we stayed with in <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Cuzco</st1:place></st1:city>\r\nwas quite poor and so accommodations were sparse.&nbsp; I\'m not sure I\'d\r\nrecommend it for most tourists but it was what we wanted and worked out.&nbsp;\r\nWe donated stuff to the local school children in Cachiccata which was a huge\r\nsuccess.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nOur guide Jose&nbsp;during the Salkantay Trek was excellent, the food was\r\nplentiful and tasty, support and service was great and they were very well\r\norganized throughout.&nbsp; It was very tough for trekkers but the horses made\r\nit vital for my young boys.&nbsp; (I ended up renting a 2nd horse so each boy\r\nhad their own at all times.&nbsp; I would recommend horses for anyone under 14\r\nand you can trek and ride as you wish, which my boys did.)&nbsp; Day 1 was very\r\ntough and the altitude one cannot really prepare for so everyone was\r\nhurting.&nbsp; But once we got over the pass and began descending on day 2 everyone\r\nrecovered quickly and seemed to enjoy the achievement and diversity of the\r\ntrek.&nbsp; On day 4, I took my boys to the <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">hot springs</st1:place></st1:city> in Santa Theresa and then met the\r\nremainder of our group at hydroelectric dam rather than trekking that\r\nday.&nbsp; This was smart and the boys loved the hot spring.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Machu Picchu</st1:place></st1:city>\r\nwas fantastic and nothing really prepares you for seeing it live.&nbsp; Our\r\nweather was great and having a guide was really important to understanding\r\neverything.&nbsp;The first 400 into MP can climb Huaynapicchu which is scary\r\nlooking and near vertical but the view from the top back toward <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Machu Picchu</st1:place></st1:city> is\r\npriceless.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nFinally, Hotel Marqueses in <st1:place w:st=\"on\">Cusco</st1:place> was really\r\ngood for the price and I would highly recommend it for service, proximity to\r\nPlaza de Armas and attractions, breakfast, etc.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThanks again for everything.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt;

We\'re back in the US now from our fabulous trip to Peru. We have lots of great pictures and lots of wonderful memories.  We take trips regularly, but this one to Peru is definitely one of the best on the list.  \r\n </p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur itinerary was well designed with a good amount time seeing the nature, modern, colonial and, of course, ancient Peru.  Lima, with its cosmopolitan and colonial facades was a great starting point.  Miguel was a great Lima city tour guide.  His knowledge about everything Peruvian, and even Latin American was outstanding. We felt very comfortable in Peru from the get-go as Miguel greeted us at the airport.  By the way, the Radisson Decapolis in Miraflores was a top-notch hip hotel. The sushi-fusion bar is classy!\r\n </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDiving into Cuzco\'s history, ancient streets and sidewalks was, of course, one of the highlights of the journey. We adapted smoothly to the high elevation of the city, and started enjoying the city and its surroundings from the first day. The folklore dance program in the evening is a must in order to learn about the different traditions and dances of the area.\r\n </p>\r\n<p>\r\nMachu Piccu goes without saying - is truly one of the wonders of the world. Pictures can\'t describe the awe and majestic views and hiking in the area.  I would say the round trip train to Machu Piccu was also reminiscent of Hiram Bingham\'s exploratory trips to the area, but in the comfort of a full view Vistadome train!\r\n </p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur final leg into Puno and Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world, and the floating islands of Uros, were something we had dreamt about for a long time.  Once we set foot on the floating islands, and started interacting and talking to the Indian inhabitants, and even had a conversation inside their house, we suddenly felt like we were taken back hundreds of years!\r\n </p>\r\n<p>\r\nChris, we would like to personally and sincerely thank you for organizing our trip to Peru.

Thus, to some extent, I was taking a risk: would your services and advises meet our expectations?\r\nWell, they were even better! We had a really great trip, whether in the Amazonian forest, the Sacred Valley, Cuzco or the Machu Picchu site, and finally the wonderful Galapagos Islands.  During our whole trip, at every place, our transfers were perfectly organized, we were met by pleasant and kind people and we had excellent guides.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA special mention of excellence to two people: our guide, Edgar, in the Sacred Valley. This guy was not only a well of science, but had this unique ability of transmitting both his knowledge of the Inca culture and his passion for archeology. And then, the adorable Allison from your office in Cuzco: we were met by her upon our arrival in Cuzco airport, coming from Puerto Maldonado.

We love traveling the world and almost always plan and journey on our own. This year we searched the internet and found several companies who offered many variations on travel plans through Peru. Why did we choose Latin America For Less? Were there prices competitive? Yes, but equal to many other companies. We chose Latin America For Less, simply because of a first phone conversation with Kristina Rudge. She phoned us back within minutes of our call, and was so helpful and patient that we felt confident we would have the personal assistance we needed. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe were right about Kristina and the rest of the staff at Latin America For Less. Kristina and I organized the trip together via email. She was prompt in her responses, on target with suggestions and above all honest about the trip. She gave us advice, made valid suggestions and sent us paperwork in a most timely fashion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo we found ourselves with all the paperwork, airline tickets and fully packed suitcases. I wouldn\'t be completely honest if I said we weren\'t nervous about the trip. Would things be as promised? Would we be picked up at each location? This trip included 3 internal flights and several bus and car trips. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe arrived late evening in Lima and waiting for us was a charming young man who had all of our travel documents, accompanied us to our hotel and spent about 45 minutes going through our itinerary and answering questions. This is how it went at every step of our voyage. We were met, escorted, assisted, doted on and had all of our needs met.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWas everything perfect? Not completely. My husband suffered from fairly severe altitude sickness. We even had to change some of our plans to accommodate this. The staff at Latin America For Less couldn\'t be more helpful changing arrangements at the last minute.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe can\'t wait to travel again to South America and will, of course, use Latin America For Less. \r\nThis is a really great agency and everyone who we dealt with there was kind, smart and helpful.\r\n</p>','Nancy <br/>\r\nNew Jersey, US <br/>\r\nCuzco, Machu Picchu, Puno, Lake Titicaca and Puerto Maldonado\r\n','rossi-nancy.jpg','Nancy Rossi','',666,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(436,1,'Dear Peru For Less','I had a wonderful trip with many exciting stories to tell!','Thanks,\r\n\r\nMary <br/>\r\nPeachtree City, GA, USA\r\n<br/>Lima, Cuzco, Machu Picchu, Puerto Maldonado\r\n\r\n','','','',142,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(437,1,'Rylee,','<p>          \r\nI just wanted to let you know that we had a wonderful time in Peru.

With your expert advice we managed to do everything we wanted to do (and more!), but without having to deal with the stresses you often incur when going to a foreign country. We also really appreciated that you were able to \"un-cancel\" our trip on such short notice.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn general we found the agents very professional. They gave us good advice and were always punctual. We also appreciate the fact that the agents often had to wait long hours for our arrival when the busses were running late. Being able to rely on the agents/agency makes a big difference to the overall experience. We appreciated receiving regular confirmations of pick up times from agents, and having 24 hour emergency numbers available for when things go wrong.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Inca trail was a definite highlight of our trip, and we are so glad that we were able to do it!  Wayki trek played an important role in making the experience so enjoyable. Our guide, Jose Cusi Camero, was superb and the porters were thoughtful, considerate and friendly and the food was delicious - especially considering the conditions in which it was prepared. Their attention to detail made the experience extra special. Jose was very good at sharing his knowledge during our \"history lessons\", was always there to help and made sure that everyone was safe and doing well during the hiking. Everything was done very professionally. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring our trip we often stayed in Casa Andina hotels, and we were very happy with these hotels.  They are always clean, neat and comfortable, provide good breakfasts, free internet and the staff are always very helpful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur agent in Cusco (Christina (?)) recommended that we include a trip to the Pisac ruins as part of our sacred valley tour. We were very glad that she made this recommendation as we really enjoyed the ruins, and the little walk we had around it and it made the day really worth it!  You should recommend it to other clients as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe thought our Colca Canyon tour guide was really good (think his name was Omar Katana); very engaging and enthusiastic.  We really got a sense that he loved the area and nature and he encouraged us to go for walks, rather than just driving to where-ever we needed to be- which made the experience more enjoyable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had a fantastic time and thank you again for all your help.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLooking forward to speaking to you again when we arrange our trip to Argentina!\r\n</p>','Kind regards,\r\n\r\nJeanne <br/>\r\nParacas/Nazca, Cuzco, Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, Lake Titicaca\r\n','','','',193,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(466,1,'Hi Kelly,','<p>Sorry for taking so long to respond. Ron has been very busy at work so I volunteered to answer your e-mail.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur trip was terrific! We had a great time and were extremely happy with the itinerary you arranged for us. Thank you so much for that and of course, we were so impressed that it was all done with less than 72hours before we left. The Peru-for-less contacts in each of the cities were very helpful and friendly (and very eager to please). Except for our small glitch (re: our flight from Arequipa to Lima), everything went off without a hitch.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe loved our trip to Machu Picchu. The Vistadome train ride was lots of fun. The tour of Machu Picchu was great. Alison (your representative in Cuzco) had told me to use insect repellent (which I forgot) and I got thousands (or so it felt like) of itchy bites on my legs. That for me was the only low point of the trip. I am happy to say I am fully recovered :). No one else was bitten.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the advice of the Machu Picchu guide, we climbed Putucusi the next day. That was tough but lots of fun for the boys (especially the ladders).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe trip to Puno was a pleasant surprise. My younger son and I suffer from motion sickness, so a 9 hour bus ride was not something we were looking forward to but the frequent stops for tours and lunch were great. The floating islands and Lake Titicaca were definitely a highlight. I would certainly recommend the Lake Titicaca tour, it was fascinating.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Colca Canyon trek was great too. Our young guide was really good and liked hiking with the boys. I think he said that our boys were the only kids he\'s seen on the trek.  It was tough, and hot. The heat probably made it tougher. The walk back up was significantly easier (it was 80% shade). We loved the \"comfortable but basic accommodations\" at the OASIS. The kids thought the mud floors and no lights was just the greatest.\r\n </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe white water rafting was the favourite part for both boys. The rapids were just thrilling and scary enough to be lots of fun. Safety wise I felt very safe (and rafting makes me nervous).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOverall I would give both you and the trip a 10/10 rating.

We had a fabulous trip to Peru and have been busy trying to catch up on work since our return. My apologies for not getting back to you sooner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After trying to pull it all together ourselves, we realized that we needed the expertise of a local agency to provide guidance and assist with our internal transportation, accommodations and transfers. Kristina at Peru For Less was simply awesome - very flexible and accommodating in meeting our requests.  We developed an itinerary that maximized our time in Peru but also allowed for some time to ourselves.  Our flights, internal transfers and tours were perfect. After travelling overnight, it was a welcome relief to see the Peru For Less sign and Tracy (our local Cuzco guide) waiting outside the Cuzco Airport. When we arrived at each new location, we were met by our local guide and promptly transferred to our hotel. We truly didn\'t need to worry about a thing - even the weather was great - only 2 afternoons of rain, beyond that very warm, loads of sun and bright blue skies. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our accommodations were fantastic. El Picoaga is a lovely colonial hotel in a great location near the Plaza de Armas. We could walk to restaurants and the sights of the city in just 2 minutes.  While visiting Machu Picchu we splurged and stayed at the Inkaterra. We spent so much time at Machu Picchu we did not have enough time to take full advantage of the activities offered by the El Pueblo. The hotel offers nature trails highlighting their extensive orchids and other programs about the area and wildlife that piqued our interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are fairly independent travelers but chose to have Peru for Less arrange a few tours for us.  While in Cuzco, we enjoyed the tour of the Sacred Valley. Mary was a great guide and we appreciated her recommendation to eat a late lunch so we could beat the crowds at Ollantaytambo. Our group \"clicked\" well and there were lots of laughs and stories shared which added to the overall experience. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machu Picchu exceeded all expectations - from the bus ride and its 18 hairpin turns to seeing llamas grazing amongst the ruins. We were fortunate to have a 2 hour private tour with Fabrizio but our time spent exploring on our own was most memorable. On our first day we hiked to the Sun Gate &amp; the Inca Bridge. It started to storm on our way back from the Sun Gate but we were not deterred and decided to go to the bridge -- what a great little hike and we are so happy that we didn\'t let the rain stop us! Based on these short hikes and the amazing views, we decided we just had to hike Waynu Picchu the next day. This option was mentioned by Tracy in Cuzco but it wasn\'t until we reached Machu Picchu that we realized what it entailed. This was by far our best experience during our visit to Peru. It is a tough hike but affords amazing views and you can truly appreciate the expanse of Machu Picchu. We chose to return to the via the trail to the Great Cavern.  The trail down included ladders, cables and steep stone stairways which were fairly challenging but the hike back to Machu Picchu was very challenging! At times we wondered if we\'d make it back in time to catch our return train to Cuzco but we persevered and ended up with plenty of time for showers, pizza and beer before our return trip. We highly recommend all of these hikes if you are in decent physical condition and take lots of water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lake Titicaca was a nice surprise. The tourist bus stops every 90 minutes, so the 11 hour trip included site-seeing, shopping and lunch and actually was okay. Our room was cozy and our view of the lake was superb. We decided to forgo the full day tour of the lake for a 1/2 day tour. This gave us a chance to have the afternoon shopping in the Puno market and to enjoy a few beers at the hotel. At the end of the trip, we enjoyed some down time to reflect and relax. While visiting the Uros Islands, our group\'s visit coincided with Miss Peru\'s tour of the island - an added bonus seeing a local celebrity. The Uros islanders were so hospitable and you are left with a great appreciation and respect for their culture and way of life. It is this part of the trip that many of my colleagues, friends and family are most interested in learning about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On our last day in Peru, we visited the Sillustani funeral towers with Junior. This was a private tour included as part of our transfer to the airport in Juliaca. Travel days always seem to be \"lost days\" as you end up hanging around airports for transfers and connections. Since our travel required overnight flights, PFL recommended a late day flight from Juliaca to Lima so that we could see this area. What a great recommendation! After we toured the chulpas, Junior took us to a local home where we sample some local food. This was a fantastic way to end our travels and added to our overall visit to the Puno area.  <p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all a great trip; thank you for all your help!</p>\r\n','Amy <br/>\r\nVermont, USA <br/>\r\nCuzco, Puno <br/>\r\n','perry-amy.jpg','','',671,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(472,1,'Hi Rylee,','<p>Our trip was excellent.

He knew just what pace to set so that we were not exhausted. In fact groups who had passed us we soon caught up to and left behind at our slow but steady pace. My wife did suffer from altitude sickness and our guide to Coca Canyon was extremely caring and helpful.

We got home and looked at each other and both said that that was by far the best vacation that either of us had ever been on. I hope that Peru For Less continues to work with Wayki Trek. This group is amazing. We were hiking along side other groups and I could tell that Wayki Trek not only takes the time to make sure that you\'re every need is met , but they are by far the most professional, knowledgeable, and happy group compared to the other companies.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur guide Antonio was amazing!  He knew everyone, everywhere.  There were many times that the people from Wayki Trek stood out as being the very best in the area and everyone in our group commented on it continuously.

There was never a moment when Peru For Less let us down.   </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDrivers, guides, representatives were prompt, polite, helpful, friendly. Miguel in Lima was so knowledgeable about the religious history -- very interesting. The desk clerk at the Casa Andina always greeted us with his beautiful smile. Johann in Chiclayo took us to some of the most fascinating archaeological sites and museums. I wished for more time there. He took us to a small recently opened restaurant -- which served one of our favorite meals (won\'t forget the sudado).  Had some freshly brewed chicha (corn beer) there. We enjoyed the drive through the sugar cane fields. Convinced him to take us to the local market, where Lucy found some treasures and I enjoyed people-watching and taking photos. Judith in Trujillo went so over and beyond. She invited us in to her home, where all of her family was so warm and hospitable. Trujillo\'s Temple of the Moon was one of the most memorable places. Chan Chan was also beautiful, awesome. Hard to believe they\'ve just begun with all that\'s there to excavate and restore. We also had an amazing meal at a restaurant with a huge buffet there. Judith led us through course after course.  We won\'t forget the ceviche. I am so glad we included the northern desert in our itinerary. Learning about the Moche and Chimu cultures provided such depth and background prior to seeing Machu Picchu.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Amazon may have been my favorite spot. It\'s hard to choose. The Inkaterra was a dream.  I hope I can return there some day. I still dream of what that dense forest sounded like -- a symphony. We also enjoyed \"Applesauce,\" the wild boar who hung around to have his belly rubbed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCuzco was a little hard at first.  The altitude was an adjustment.  We were glad we had some off-time to just lounge. The first night though, we dragged ourselves out and heard music on the square -- a brass band, a torch singer, and a musical group. Such fun! The city was like a fairy land at night. We loved our hotel, The Arqueologo. We discovered its cozy bar and ended up being alone in there at times in the evening -- sitting on the comfortable love seats in front of the fire, being served tapas and delicious Peruvian wine. We heard the opera singing waiters and waitresses at the restaurant next door. Maria Elena, our tour guide there, was also a gem. The drive through the Sacred Valley was memorable. We also enjoyed the colorful Pisac Market.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom there we were off to Machu Pichu and of course it was sensational. We loved the Inkaterra Hotel. Had a tour of their lovely orchid garden and saw numerous hummingbirds of all colors and sizes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur final treat was taking that fabulous train to Puno (thank you for your suggestion there, so worth it) and then staying with the family on Amantani Island. Lucy and I were both a bit trepidatious about this, but we had a magical stay. Despite our language differences, we somehow communicated and felt so warmly held by them. We did lots of climbing and saw the sun set on one side of the island and the moon rise on the other. We want to go back. We want to go back to all the places we went. Hopefully we\'ll be able to.

Visiting Machu Pichu was a priceless experience and you made it absolutely enjoyable by organizing every detail of our trip with perfection. I have traveled quite a bit and most definitely this trip was scores a 10/10 for a very well organized and hassle-free as far as travel arrangements are concerned.\r\n\r\nAt the outset I am very appreciative of the fact that you communicated with me even before my trip began and made sure that I had all the details handy. My surprise came in when I actually arrived at Lima and was painlessly transferred to my destination and every person who met us at the airports and transported us to the hotels was just there for us. Every person who met us and detailed us of our daily agenda were very prompt and clear on the plan and gladly answered any questions/concerns we had. It definitely was a luxury to have a well planned trip.\r\n\r\nThe 4 day Inca trail was the highlight of the trip. Even though it was painful :) - it was definitely worth it when we finally arrived at Machu Pichu. Our guide Edgar is a very proud CuzqueÃ±an (rightfully so) and is extremely knowledgeable. I liked his dedication to the trail and the moral support that he gave me all the way through the trail (since I was the slowest in my group, he made sure to stay with me all the way and encouraged me to push harder every time - especially the second day). My heart goes to the 5 porters who carried our camping/food gear with so much ease and were always there at the campsite when we got there with our hot meals/teas. They were the real heroes.\r\n\r\nThe 4th night and 5th day at Aguas Calientes was such a welcome spot after the strenuous hike. \r\n\r\nThe hotels at Cuzco and Aguas Calientes were spotlessly clean and well maintained.\r\n\r\nThe 3 day trip to the Posadas Amazonas Jungle Lodge was one of kind experience. Loved the experience of sleeping in a jungle lodge (although could hardly sleep on first night with all the jungle noises around - but it was worth the experience).

I am very glad that we included an initial period of 24 hours of relaxation and accommodation upon our arrival in Cuzco.

(Future Peru For Less travelers may want to know that the Pakaritampu\'s grounds are beautifully maintained and that the hotel buildings are separated from the traffic on the adjoining street by a wall and gate. Some of the Ollantaytambo ruins can be seen from the Pakaritampu\'s garden, and this is aided by a telescope that is set up there.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile I don\'t want to sleight the superb service provided by their hotel colleagues (from the front desk to the porters), I want to make special mention of the maitres d\'hotel at the Casa Andina, Emilio, and at the Sumaq, Erick. They and their staffs made us feel both pampered and at-home and they were most helpful in dealing with the special dietary needs of some in our group. In each case, a wide variety and generous amount of food was available for the buffet breakfast; and the Casa Andina had a friendly and efficient chef stationed in the dining room to make eggs to order.  I have to add that the quality of the food preparation and presentation at the Sumaq (where both breakfast and dinner were included in our room rate) was worthy of a dining room in a major city and quite a surprise in the isolated hamlet of Aguas Calientes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe were pleasantly surprised by the provision of a full breakfast (complete with tablecloths) on the early morning train from Cuzco to Machu Picchu.

I loved all the tours in each city, as it was a smaller group so it made it easy to listen to the guide and also the guide was more flexible with the day. For instance, our day into the Sacred Valley, Mary the guide suggested we do the Pisac market in the afternoon instead and see the ruins earlier in the day to avoid the rain - everyone in the group was in agreement since the day before it was raining so hard that we had to miss some of the ruins on account of the weather.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe restaurant recommendations were great.

Overall, the whole trip speaks to the company and their attention to detail and customer service. I did not expect a representative to pick us up from the airport or brief us at each destination individually; I thought there would be other groups of people for this and I was thoroughly happy at the personal touch.

A tremendous compliment to your guides in Lima, Puerto Maldonado, Cusco, Machu Picchu, Sacred Valley and Puno- it was such a pleasure to see how dedicated and accommodating they all were and how much they all could tell about the places we have been to. I am so glad that you were able to include a trip to the Maras Moray salt mines, as that was certainly one of the most impressive places we have ever been to; my kids must have taken at least 100 pictures that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our stay in the Refugio Amazonas jungle lodge in the rainforest was a blast. It was a great place to stay and our guide Carol was one of the nicest people we have ever met. It was a great experience to learn about all the environmental efforts and activities that take place in this well protected part of the jungle.  Both our kids (17 and 20) enjoyed every second of our stay.\r\nNext to visiting Machu Picchu of course, we consider the train ride from Cusco to Puno as one of the highlights of our trip; we were thrilled that our guide in Cusco was able to arrange the trip in spite of the ongoing railway strikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could go on for ages, but the bottom-line is that this was one of the best travel experiences we ever had.   Peru for Less had not been able to do a better job. We are impressed by the quality of your service, people and communication. My special thanks to you Aimee!

The rest of the transfers went well overall.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>In terms of tours, we enjoyed the Lima tour for two reasons.  One, it covered the key old town areas well enough so we did not feel the need to go there later and it met for the tour bus at a park next to Huaca Pucllana which is from the 7th century AD.  On the last day we walked there and enjoyed a very fine tour (they have English guides) and gained a little insight into the Lima culture along with a small section on some common plants and animals. You also see the surrounding town to provide an interesting juxtoposition. I would recommend this to clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tour of Cusco was also fine as we covered the Cathedral and its Monastery and another musuem along with Suscayhuaman.

She got us to our transportation very quickly and met us shortly afterwards at the hotel to go over our itinerary and answer questions. She also gave us personal recommendations for restaurants which we relied on during the course of the week and we were never disappointed. Maria was our guide for Cuzco and the Sacred Valley and Mr. Renato was our driver. We cannot say enough about the two of them. They were always on time for the tours and more often they were early. Mr. Renato was an excellent driver, his vehicle was spotless and he was courteous and thoughtful. Maria was a jewel. She was so knowledgeable and it was obvious that she was enthusiastic about her role as our tour guide. Both were eager and willing to accommodate when we requested a change in the itinerary, as when we requested to go to the Seminario in Urubamba. When we parted with them at the end of the week, it was as though we were parting with friends. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fabrizio was our guide at Machu Picchu.

We both had hard time breathing, got headaches and sleeping was tough. The guided trip we took was great; buses and guide were very nice.  The guide took us to a wonderful store for buying alpaca clothes where we felt like we had personal shoppers.  We loved being able to negotiate prices.</p>\r\n<p>During the Sacred Valley Tour once again the bus and guide were excellent.  This was likely the best guided tour we took. The valley, markets, food, sights, all of it was just really incredible. Highlights were shopping in the market, seeing the weavers and stopping by the local pub to drink with locals.</p>\r\n<p>Once we got to Aqua Caliente the bag transfer to hotel and getting on the bus to Machu Picchu was very smooth. The bus ride was amazing. We absolutely loved the Machu Picchu site. We had a great lunch and were really impressed in every way.  Weather could not have been more perfect and loved the passport stamp. We then went to our hotel where we found our room to be one of their best.</p>\r\n<p>In Puerto Maldonado once again our transfer to the airport was easy and helpful, both the coordinator and driver were great. Once we arrived the guide was waiting for us and took us to the transfer office.</p>\r\n<p>Our boat ride was really relaxing, exciting and enjoyable.  We loved the lunch of rice, eggs and mushrooms wrapped in the leaf. The checkpoint station was easy and we loved being able to stamp our passport for the Amazon.</p>\r\n<p>The arrival to the Refugio Amazonas lodge while walking was very exciting.  We loved the touch of greeting us with a fruit drink. Our room was great, although it takes some getting used to an open view to the jungle.</p>\r\n<p>Our first night boat trip looking for caimans was a great way to begin. All of the food here was wonderful, including the drinks of pisco sour, hot chocolate and tea. Our guide was very knowledgeable, funny, professional and helpful.  We can\'t compliment him enough. We loved all the guided tours where we saw the diversity in the forest and enjoyed the other group members.  This location seemed to be a key spot for families. The highlights were climbing the canopy tower, learning about the medicinal plant life, touring the farm, paddling in the lake, seeing the large trees and Treina loved her massage.  </p>\r\n<p>All in all we very much enjoyed the trip, </p>\r\n','Eric <br/>\r\nLima, Cuzco, Machu Picchu, The Amazon<br/>\r\n','','','',711,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(647,1,'Dear Jennifer,','<p>We returned safe and sound to Belgium after the fantastic Salkantay hiking trip and the visit to Machu Pichu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Salkantay trip is beautiful and sometimes hard because of the adaptation to the height which is not so easy to deal with especially during the first days.

We have been planning our trip to Peru since last September and hate that is now over.  As you know we had hundreds of questions, all which you answered patiently, always clarifying any of our concerns with your prompt email communications.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>First let me start that this is the first time that I have used a travel agency from the internet.  I used the Frommer Guide book as a guide and wrote to several agencies about how we wanted to do our trip and estimated costs.  Of all the emails we sent out for information yours was the one that stood out the most.  You assured us that we could plan our trip just the way we wanted and not have to be part of a larger tour group.  Of course we had lots of doubts about the arrangements, the accommodations, and the logistics all which you helped in making our decisions.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a breakdown of our trip.  We arrived in Lima late and tired on Friday, June 25. We were immediately greeted by Miguel who took us to the waiting van and on to our first stay at the lovely Bed and Breakfast, Second Home.  We immediately fell in love with this historic home and were very happy with our room with the view of the Pacific Ocean.  The next day we explored the grounds and got a personal tour of Victor Delphin\'s artist studio.  Miguel picked us up as scheduled gave us an informative tour of historic Lima.  We enjoyed his company so much that we invited him to join us for our delicious lunch of Peruvian delicacies and of course our first taste of Pisco Sour.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We left for Cuzco on Sunday, on time and on schedule and arrived at Cuzco.  We were once again greeted by a representative from Peru for Less, Emelie, who orientated us to Cuzco, went over our admissions to Machu Picchu, and the travel arrangements to Agua Calientes.  We enjoyed our  free time is Cuzco exploring the Plaza, the San Blas neighborhood, taking a tour of the Temple of the Sun, and  hiring a taxi driver to show us the ruins above the city.  We had no trouble with the altitude and enjoyed our meals at the Inka Grill, Pachapappa, and Cicciolina\'s, all which were first class. We loved our hotel Picoaga and we pleased that we were in the older, colonial section as we had requested. Thanks, Kelly, we were sure that you put in a special request.    Our room was charming with a balcony facing the street and lovely view of the inner courtyard getting to and from our room.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We left for Machu Picchu on Tuesday and again were very pleased that our transportation arrived just as promised.  We appreciated the reminders and the communication about our travel plans with the hotel staff.  We enjoyed the leg of our journey in the newly refurbished Backpacker Train. Thanks again for making this change from our original plans.   We arrived at Agua Calientes and was greeted by a representative from Peru for Less who showed us how to get to our hotel and dropped us of at a caf&eacute; to enjoy a leisurely lunch.  Fabricio, our guide, called that evening and we arranged to meet him on Wednesday at 1:30 for our tour of the mountain.  We loved your suggestion of having the full day on the mountain Wednesday.  Wayne and Larry left at 6:30 AM and Cinda and I joined them around 9:30 AM.  We thoroughly enjoyed this incredible sight were glad to have the additional educational insights with Fabricio later that afternoon. It was well worth to the 4,000 mile journey to experience this indescribable place.  The Hatuchay Tower hotel was wonderful with an incredible, accommodating staff.  What a beautiful hotel and we were so surprised about our lovely and delicious gourmet dinner.  It certainly was not typical of our hotel food back in the states.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We left for our trip back to Cuzco on Wednesday night and arrived back to the Picoaga hotel even receiving the same room that we had left on Tuesday morning.  On Thursday, once again our transportation was ready to take us to the Cuzco airport for our flight to Puerto Maldonado.  At the airport we were greeted by a representative from our lodge Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica.  We got in the open Safari wagon and were transported to the reception area where we were greeted with cool towels and refreshing drink.  After our boat trip down the Madres the Dios river we thought we had arrived at \"Fantasy Island\" since we were greeted with a ringing bell and the smartly, uniformed staff waiting by the landing. We immediately met our interpreter Wilson who shared with us the many wonderful expeditions that we could participate in during our stay.  We then were ushered into the beautiful main lodge for our first of many delicious meals.  We loved our cute cabin right by the river, (thanks again, Kelly), and our entire experience at this beautiful lodge. The highlight of our stay was doing the canopy walk, seeing the monkeys and the river otters at Lake Sandoval, and connecting with others from all part of the world. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hated to leave this beautiful place but we very happy with our hotel Casa Andina Private Collection back in Lima.  Once again your representatives picked us up at the airport and took us back to the airport the next day for our flight back to the states on time and on schedule.    </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We highly recommend our itinerary to other travelers and will recommend you and Peru for Less to any others who want to visit this beautiful country.  Thanks again for making our trip so special and for your patience in answering all of our many questions.  We appreciate you and your great communication in making this one of our very favorite trips. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fondly, </p>\r\n','Cristina and Wayne <br />\r\nRoanoke, VA  <br />\r\nLima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, the Amazon\r\n','','','',709,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(669,1,'Kristina,','<p>I want to thank you for organizing such a nice tour of Peru for the 6 of us.

First let me say that I have been recommending Peru For Less to everyone with whom we spoke. It was so easy working with you to plan the itinerary and then the guides and drivers were fantastic. We could not have asked for more. It was so enjoyable because they are so knowledgeable and proud of their history as they should be. Maria, Carlos, and Miguel were outstanding and certainly enhanced everything that we had read on our own.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Emily was truly well organized and got us situated very nicely in Cuzco with the hotel, tours and general information. Our drivers, such as Felix, were great and always on time. They certainly handle the road expertly. Felix knew of a great shortcut when we were stuck in traffic.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Then hotels and their staff were outstanding.  The breakfasts were more than we could have ever hoped.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The people are wonderful - helpful, informative, curious, proud.  One local artisan even gave me an herb, not cocoa, to combat the altitude sickness that affected my husband and my son\'s girlfriend.  His wife told us about her grandmother who was a shaman and showed us photographs.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Machu Picchu was breathtaking - everything from the journey there to the actual days spent visiting the site. It was breathtaking and lush and overwhelming.  Two days was not enough.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In Lima, we enjoyed the city tour with Miguel, but we also explored the pyramid/site that was being restored. I don\'t recall the name. We had a great tour and were able to walk on the actual site and observe the work being done.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The food was exceptional everywhere we went. In Aguas Calientes we ate at Indoio Feliz - the kids\' favorite meal.  In Barranco, we happended upon a restaurant that is housed in a family home and the local women prepare the meals.  It is called Songoro Cosango, Ayacucho281, Puente De Los Suspiros - excellent. In Cuzco the kids really liked Jack\'s up the street from the cathedral.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The surfing experience was fun for my son and his girlfriend. We arranged the day ahead of time with Antonio who owns Penascal in San Bartolo. The kids had a lesson, rented the wet suits and towels and were into water for about two hours. The waves make the California waves seem like gentle ripples.  Needless to say the kids were never able to get up but they had fun.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Included in the day was what I consider to be the best meal that I had on our vacation.  Everything is prepared in Antonio\'s home. I had a fish called corvina which I think was Chilean Sea Bass that was freshly caught that morning.  The kids had beef - my son the tenderloin and the girls what looked like a minute steak. We had a vegetable quiche as a starter. The meal included appetizers, rice, beans and dessert - banana in a sweet syrup. My husband opted for a museum day so he missed out on a great meal.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>If any of your clients are interested in surfing I highly recommend Antonio Tello at Penascal Surf. Great experience all around.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>I truly enjoyed working with you and plan on using your services when we plan another South American sojourn.</p>\r\n','Hans and Liz Maurer<br />\r\nMilford, CT<br />\r\nJune 24-July 2<br />\r\nLima, Cuzco and Machu Picchu\r\n','','','',283,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(672,1,'Kristina,','<p>From the start, I knew I was in good hands with Peru for Less.

I want to especially mention our guide Paul in Paracas. My husband had a stomachache on the morning of our Ballestas Islands tour and couldn\'t make it to the tour with me. When I was taken back to the hotel afterwards, without me requesting, Paul asked the hotel if we could delay our checkout for a couple of hours so my husband could get a little more rest in our room. He also took us on a side trip to Ica later that afternoon, which was not planned on our itinerary, and visited a couple of wineries and the sand dunes before taking us toy the Ica bus station to catch the bus that we originally should have taken in Paracas.</p>\r\n<p>On our Sacred Valley tour, we mentioned to our guide Ronny that we wanted to try chica. So he ended up taking us to a chicheria on the way to try some homemade chica, which became a little highlight of our trip!

We were able to relax totally because everything had been arranged in advance-there was no worrying about where we were supposed to be or how we would get there. The people we interacted with were such a huge part of making us feel comfortable and welcomed: Our drivers and tour guides were friendly, professional, and very knowledgable and entertaining. Caitlin, in Cusco, was especially helpful, and it was reassuring to know she was just a phone call away should we need anything. Even when our plans changed at the last minute, such as when a workers\' strike shut down the roads our last day in Cusco, Caitlin had backup plans and was able to help us stay on schedule.</p>\r\n<p>While we had an amazing experience in Machu Picchu (and that was mainly the purpose of our trip), our rainforest adventure was really the highlight. Our lodge, Refugio Amazonas, in which we stayed at your suggestion, was perfect for us: It was just rustic enough (not too much like camping, which I appreciated) while still being a little bit posh (I got the best massage of my life there!). We were combined with two other groups of travelers in our tour group, and we all really bonded and got to know and like each other in the few days we had together. Our guide, Aldo, was in part responsible for creating a sense of community, and we can\'t say enough good things about him: Friendly, funny, helpful, really informative, entertaining, he was exactly who we needed to interpret our surroundings and make it a fun and memorable experience. I only wish we had had more time to spend in the rainforest - we did not want to leave!\r\nThis trip was one of the best we\'ve ever taken, and PFL helped make it such a positive, easy experience.

Before planning the trip I looked up the company Peru For Less. I worked with a travel advisor named Rylee McGowan. I started our travel plans in May for our trip in July. I picked through and questioned every item on our itinerary and Rylee patiently answered all the questions without once losing her cool. Whenever I was not sure of a hotel choice she guided me with suggestions but never forced me into committing to one over the other. I even questioned her whether she had taken this trip and she mentioned she did the trip with her father who was in his 60â??s which helped since I was taking this trip with my parents who were in their 70â??s. Also, I wanted to pack in a lot of stuff during our limited time and wanted to go to Lake Titicaca as well. But Riley guided me and made me see that this would not be a good idea. She also suggested that we stay overnight in the Machu Picchu area which was very good advice. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do not speak Spanish and it was nice to be met at the airport by a representative and taken to the hotel. All of our domestic transportation was included in the price â?? local tours, train & plane tickets. Our tours in Lima and Cusco were private tours and it was just us. The Puerto Maldonado tour had 3 other people. We were in the jungle and we understood the need for the pairing â?? the literature did mention that groups may be paired up to 10 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me the best part of the trip was that I could choose the dates I wanted to travel and the places I wanted to go. Also, the little details that were taken care of â?? such as someone meeting us at the airport, taking us to the hotel, giving us a tour, buying the tickets to the local sights as well train and plane tickets. A land slide meant that we had to leave from a different station for Machu Picchu. This was taken care of - I probably could have done it on my own if I was doing this trip without a tour company but it was their headache and not mine and I didn\'t have to worry. Also the private tours were a bonus. In Cusco on Day 1, neither of my parents wanted the tour after we arrived and the guide dropped them off at the hotel and the three of us did the tour on our own. Day 2 of our stay in Cusco one of our parents opted out and this was fine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We missed our connection in Atlanta and we called the emergency number and they took down our new flight number and everything was taken care of at their end. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recommend this company without hesitation.</p>\r\n','Nagulinie <br/>\r\nManlius, New York, USA<br/>\r\nLima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, and Puerto Maldonado    \r\n','','','',280,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(679,1,'Hi, Riley,','<p>My husband and I wanted to take some of our grandchildren to see the country where he was born and raised.

The hotels and tours were great. Thank you for your suggestions; they were all \'on target\'. We very much enjoyed the Inka Trail and Machu Picchu was a Wonder. The trip lived up to every expectation, which is always high praise as we all set unrealistic expectations. Thanks again to you and everyone at Peru For Less for everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we\'re home and have had a few days to reflect I wanted to share with you, and hopefully you\'ll share with everyone who had a hand in making our trip as wonderful as it was, the heartfelt \"thank you\'s\" we wish to share. It\'s rare that a trip doesn\'t suffer some unforeseen blip or some change of plan. In our case, on this trip, with Peru-for-Less and Wayki Trek\'s help, this trip not only was perfect in execution but met ALL of our expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start, we were fortunate to have worked with Kristina Rudge in the planning of this little family adventure. We are a family of 6 with 4 daughters (the youngest 9) and this was the biggest trip, by far, we\'d ever  taken. Kristina helped us flesh out the details of the trip. Her personal experience with Peru was invaluable in helping us plan and her patience (diplomatically guiding us from the unreasonable to the reasonable) was appreciated. In the end we relied on a number of her suggestions and are thankful for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essence of our trip was the Inka Trail (4 day trek) and Machu Picchu. We added day trips in Cuzco and a tour of the Sacred Valley for 2 days while we acclimated to the elevation.  Susanna met us in Cuzco and walked us through our itinerary. Since she lives in Cuzco she proved to be a wealth of information for us (restaurants, do\'s/don\'t\'s, etc.) and the girls loved her.  Rony was our guide for both our day trip in Cuzco and the tour of the Sacred Valley. A bright, knowledgeable guy whose English was excellent, he took a shine to our 9 year old. In 2 days the girls received a history lesson that outstripped anything they could have received in a classroom (us, too).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then it was time for our trek. We met our guide, Fredy, the evening before and were on our way early the next morning. There\'s no way we can sum up in a short note all of our great experiences in those 4 days. Fredy was wonderful. If you\'re fortunate to have him as your guide you are in great hands. A wealth of historical, cultural, botanical, and geologic knowledge is contained in a personable and patient personality (remember he had 4 girls to help shepherd). The food was great. Our cook, Elias, was able to do things on a trail stove that many restaurants are not able to do. And as for Wayki Trek and our porters, all I can say is thank you. I commend Peru-for-Less for partnering with a local trekking organization that is entirely indigenous owned. I think the pride they take in making their company successful matters in the service they provide. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The climax of our trip, Machu Picchu, is truly a Wonder of the World and in the planning we arranged for a 2nd day (after arriving from the trek) there. We highly recommend that. The day you arrive after being on the trail for 4 days is magical as the Sun has not yet arisen on your first view of Machu Picchu coming through the Sun Gate. But you are tired and after several hours there, a break is needed. For us, going down to Aguas Calientes for R &amp; R allowed us to recharge and return to Machu Picchu on day 2 with fresh eyes. While we didn\'t experience the hot springs in Aguas Calientes, we did have some great food.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As for the rest, well, our biggest concern with 4 daughters with us, was the transitions and transfers. These were managed perfectly. Thank you.

We were looking to customize a trip for our own interests with flexibility, but we also wanted to minimize the headaches of trying to get around completely on our own in South America over great distances.  </p>\n\n<p>We considered a few in-country agencies to start, but we decided to go with Peru For Less given their good reviews and frankly their being based in the US for peace of mind. We emailed Riva Bacquet, their representative based in Lima, dozens of times to customize a trip to Lima, Puerto Maldonado, Cusco, Urubamba Valley, Machu Picchu, Puno, Colca Canyon, and Arequipa.  Riva is superb.  She patiently responded with itinerary options for various scenarios that we considered... All the while offering what turned out to be exceptionally good advice on our trip.  All communication was prompt, friendly, and professional via email and phone.  </p>\n\n<p>But the real test was being there. We went with mid-range 3-star accommodations for what we think was an unbeatable price. All accommodations exceeded our expectations for the costs.  All were centrally located, clean and safe.  All connections were flawless for the most part and pick-up drivers were prompt and courteous.  The bottom line: we minimized the hassle of figuring out connections and accommodations, and maximized our time in each location.  In most cases, excursions were pre-planned though we\'d custom built in time to explore on our own with Riva\'s help.  </p>\n\n<p>The guides that Peru For Less arranged were all superior. In some cases, we had private tours (at no extra cost as far as we could tell) that were fantastic.  I honestly can\'t imagine covering as much ground in such a short time (yet it truly being quality time) without these folks and their expertly planned excursions, particularly in Peru where the distances to hot spots are relatively great.  Renting a car or busing on your own didn\'t seem like an option as in other parts of the world unless you had weeks upon weeks to get around Peru.  </p>\n\n<p>I ended up taking 6,200 photos in two weeks...we absolutely had the time of our lives marveling at the wonders of Peru.  And they are completely accessible in Peru via phone.  On one connection, we decided to make a time change and called the 24-hour number, and they said no problem and hooked us up.  Just one hiccup, we got to Arequipa and for some reason our reservation at the hotel was canceled.  Turns out they\'d upgraded us to a fancier hotel.  Some hiccup, eh?  I highly recommend Peru For Less and Riva Bacquet in particular.  </p>\n\n<p>The Peru For Less representative that met us in Cusco, Caitlyn, was world class.  We didn\'t have any trouble ourselves with losing luggage, but it\'s inevitable.  When we arrived in Cusco, Caitlyn met us at the airport.  We needed to wait a few minutes for her to retrieve another client\'s luggage and it was comforting to us to know that Peru For Less had folks on the ground chasing down such things for travelers.  She came with us to the hotel and gathered us around the lobby table to assure we had all tickets, transfer documents, itineraries, etc. for our adventures.  </p>\n\n<p>One last staff comment. We didn\'t realize that Miguel was an employee.  He gave a fantastic tour of Lima that was one of our favorites.  Well, it took us a few weeks since our return from Peru to write up a good review for these well-deserving folks, but they truly bent over backwards to assure we had a great honeymoon.  The next time we travel to Latin American, you can bet we\'ll use them.  </p>\n\n<p>Hands down A+ travel service. Well done, Peru For Less.

All of the transfers to and from airports and coach stations went smoothly, we were always given times to be picked and everyone was on time, so that gave us peace of mind.  Our hotels were all very clean and comfortable with friendly helpful staff, and we couldn\'t fault any of the food.  Found Peru to be a fascinating and interesting country, with diverse landscapes, from the coast to high Andes, we found all of the guides extremely knowledgeable and genuinely interested in promoting their country.  We did suffer from the altitude going to Colca Canyon, but guide and driver very supportive and understanding.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Overall we had a fantastic trip, we did not have one overall highlight, but obviously Machu Picchu and travelling through the Sacred Valley and discovering the Inca history was fascinating, but seeing 15-20 condors flying low over us at Colca Canyon was quite spectacular.</p>\r\n','Heather &amp; Neil <br />\r\nUK<br />\r\nLima, Ica, Nazca, Arequipa, Colca Canyon, Puno, Lake Titicaca, Cusco, Machu Picchu<br />\r\n','','','',724,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(737,1,'Hi Rylee,','<p>We are back from a trip of a lifetime. Thank you so much for all your help. The hotels and arrangements were all wonderful. I would highly recommend all of the hotels where we stayed. The representatives who met us at each stop were superb--friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, on time. Just for your information, the only problem we had was with our reservation from Lima to Puno. Apparently, the reservation number matched a flight for 12 noon rather than 2:30. The airline was great, and got our flight changed, but thank goodness there was room on the flight. </p>\r\n<p>The train rides were highlights, both the vistas and the service. What a difference from air travel today. Definitely the way to go in Peru if you have the time. </p>\r\n<p>I cannot begin to tell you how spectacular the Inca Trail was. We were so right that if you have the physical stamina, this is the way to see Machu Picchu. The trail was incredibly beautiful, and the ruins along the way prepare you for Machu Picchu in a way that riding the bus could never do. Wayki was terrific. Edwin, our guide, was the best. He took care of us \"chicas\" every minute. He said it was his first all female trip, and he and all the porters treated us like queens. We were wakened to tea and hot water to wash in our tents, and went to sleep by having them check to make sure we were all carefully zipped in our tents. Every meal was special; how they do that on a two burner stove, I will never know. Edwin, was knowledgeable of the trail and through excellent planning and timing, kept us away from the crowds, both on the trail and in the campsites. I fell and sprained my ankle and scrapped my knee on the lst morning of the trail, and he expertly took care of both. We felt we were in very good hands the entire trip.</p>\r\n<p>There is one problem on the trail that I know you are in no way responsible for, but we want to pass on in the event you can have some leverage with the park or with the trail tour companies. The toilet facilities are totally inadequate for the number of persons on the trail using them. They get very dirty very fast, at times we gagged, just getting near them. Consequently, many (most) people don\'t even use them, choosing to use the woods along the trail or near the campsites. This means there is toilet paper all around the campsites and all along the trail in every potentially beautiful grotto. Often the smell along the trail is nauseous.  I know we and I assume most campers would gladly pay more for the use of more and cleaner toilets along the trail. In the states, campers must have separate toilet tents with portable toilets in most parks. Any solution would be better than the unsanitary conditions at present. This marred what should have been a pristine hiking experience.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, one last note. We discussed one evening what we think is an unfortunate name for your company. \"Peru For Less\" suggests low cost, but does nothing to suggest the quality of your services. Frankly, if I had not had a recommendation from a friend, I would not have gone with you, as the name suggests cost as the primary factor. Let me say, I am an experienced traveler, and you and your company are top-notch. I cannot see that one detail was spared. You planned the trip exactly as we wanted, let us choose the accommodations, allowing us to be on our own, yet taking the hassle out of transfers and reservations. We had terrific representatives at each stop that we could call if we needed more information (and we did). Maybe you need a tag line something along the lines of \"the best doesn\'t have to cost more\". That is what we got, absolutely the best at a very reasonable price.</p>\r\n','Dina  (Williamson group)<br />\r\nGalveston, TX<br />\r\nLima, Puno, Cusco, Inca Trail to Machu PIcchu<br />\r\n','','','',725,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(738,1,'Hi Rylee,','<p>We had the most memorable and awesome experience in Peru.

That being said, here\'s some feedback for you.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>All of the transfers worked wonderfully. We had a delayed flight from Puerto Maldonado -- about three hours. Julio was still waiting for us when we arrived. Unfortunately we basically missed the city tour with a guide. However, Julio, the driver, took us through the central area so we could get a peak and then took us to Miraflores for dinner. After a quick dinner we joined another pickup on the way back to the airport. Julio patched this arrangement together for us. It was interesting since he didn\'t speak English and my Spanish is barely passable. I butcher the language but generally get my question or point across. I can\'t say enough about Julio accommodating us.  He was outstanding.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>All the hotels were very nice with wonderful breakfasts. I would highly recommend them.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Suzana in Cusco was really helpful. She recommended a number of sights and restaurants. We ate following her recommendations and were never disappointed. She was great. The day tours in Cusco were nice and I think Rony did a nice job. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Inca Trail company did a wonderful job. As you may know, we had one member of our group that wasn\'t capable of walking the entire trail. Jose adjusted the trip for her so she could hike the first day, return with one porter, and then meet us at Machu Picchu. It worked really well for all involved. We had requested a guide with birding knowledge. Jose knew some birds, but a little more birding experience on his part would have been nice. On the day we went over the pass (day two) we didn\'t have lunch until we got to camp at about 4:00. There was a snack on the trail but it was a long day. I told this to Suzana too. Otherwise, the hike was great. Jose and all the porters were exceptionally friendly. The food was delicious. The overall service was wonderful. It may be that we had a warm spell. If had to pack over again, I would have brought shorts to hike in and more short-sleeve T-shirts. I had too much warm gear.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>The Posada Amazonas in Puerto Maldonado was really nice.   We weren\'t quite prepared for the lack of electricity.  I\'m not sure if you could have given us more info up front or we were so focused on packing for the Inca Trail that we didn\'t think it through well. Oscar, our guide, was an excellent birder. He knew the calls, had an iPod to draw them in and was exactly what wanted. When we met him at the airport he asked if we had a spotting scope. We didn\'t bring one because we were led to believe that he would have one. In the end it didn\'t matter too much since a majority of the birds were at close quarters where a scope doesn\'t help. All the people there were friendly, and the food was wonderful. This place was perfect for birding and to see something more in Peru. We\'re very glad you suggested it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The overall trip was wonderful and we only had minor issues.  Again, I would recommend your service to anyone planning a trip to Peru.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n','Hampton <br/>\r\nVA, USA<br/>\r\nLima, Cusco, Inca Trail, Machu Picchu & Puerto Maldonado \r\n','','','',414,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(785,1,'Hi Kristina,','<p>The trip was outstanding. Everybody in the group truly enjoyed themselves. It was an exhausting adventure but well worth it. I think the altitude in Puno hit us and myself particularly, pretty hard. But we had a great time none the less. All of our transfers, except Puno, worked out extremely well. Suzan was great and she had a fantastic personality. She made all of us feel extremely welcome when we reached Cusco and she gave us very helpful information on restaurants, markets, etc to visit while in Cusco. I loved Cusco. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fabricio also did an outstanding job during our private tour of Machu Picchu. Brian and I were able to spend some time going through Machu Picchu, after we visited the Sun Gate, prior to our tour. Fabricio pointed out so many wonderful details and provided great history that we didnâ??t, and never would have picked up on our own while going through the ruins. Lauralee, Deb, and Ted were able to go out on Lake Titicaca for the overnighter. They said they really enjoyed it and were happy they did it. The rest of us managed to make it to Uros despite being ill. It was a great experience all around. Everyone in the group was happy that Peru For Less was involved. It freed us up to simply enjoy our trip, confident that the details were taken care of for us. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for all of your help in setting  up this trip Kristina.

Your charming Peru For Less representative in Cuzco met us and served us coca tea immediately on arrival at the hotel (for the altitude), briefed us on our itinerary, and got us set up comfortably in the hotel. We were totally enthralled with Machu Picchu and the raft trip was great; both greatly exceeded expectations. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was great having your representative meet us very early in the morning, have our tickets for the return flight ready for us,  escort us all the way to security, and bid us a genuinely fond farewell. It was a great positive surprise to find that the tour in Lima was private and the guide was very knowledgeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can\'t say enough for the tour guides at Machu Picchu and on the raft trip.  The Machu Picchu guide was exceptionally considerate. He insisted frequently from the very start that we go slowly, that he lend me a hand on the steps and rough places and he even insisted on carrying my large heavy purse. He was very knowledgeable answering all of our many questions; I would highly recommend him to any future visitors. The raft trip guide was also very experienced, managing to negotiate us through what were for me frightening but exciting rapids; Jessica was probably of some help in the rowing, but I doubt that I was. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks again for all you did to make our trip so wonderful and for being so gracious and patient with all my questions. </p>\r\n','Jane <br/>\r\nMO, USA<br/>\r\nLima, Cusco, and Machu Picchu\r\n','','','',414,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(787,1,'hi Peruforless,','<p>At the end of October 2010, we decided to take advantage of a free week in December between family events in New York City, to travel to Machu Picchu. After we looked into the possible itinerary, we knew that we needed a professional and experienced travel company that could make this trip a reality given our limitation of time.  During an internet search of travel companies in Peru, I discovered Peru For Less. They advertised a 4-day tour, which, on the last day, included a trip to Machu Picchu.  When we read the itinerary proposed b Peru For Less, it seemed that someone in the company had designed the trip especially for us.  Obviously, Peru For Less has had many one-week customers, eager to see as much as possible in a short time.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We dealt with Kelly Chrystal who was assigned to us and who, from our very first e-mail correspondence, seemed like a perfect fit.  Kelly saw to every detail of our trip and even made suggestions on how best to prepare for it.  When we told her we were vegetarians, Kelly immediately e-mailed us a list of what turned out to be wonderful vegetarian restaurants in Cusco, which was our home base.  Each restaurant we tried was better than the next.  Kelly also sent us reminders and updates throughout our planning stages and by the time we made our final payment (also done very easily through PayPal), we felt that our every need was attended to.  A tribute to Kelly and to Peru For Less is that we never made one phone call to check up on or to change our itinerary.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>When we got to Peru, we were met at the airport by another Peru For Less representative, Suzannah, who immediately made us feel welcome.  Our luggage did not make it from Lima to Cusco on the day we arrived, but thanks to Suzannah\'s follow-up, our suitcases were delivered to our room at Casa Andina Catedral Hotel the next morning. Hint: we always travel with at least one change of clothes in our carry-ons.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Our guides, selected by Peru For Less were all English-speakers and very knowledgeable about their country.  We fell in love with Cusco and with Incan history.  Every minute of our 4 days was filled and everything ran like clockwork.  Since we are rather seasoned travelers, we know how much work goes into planning and carrying out an itinerary that is adhered to, minute by minute.  At no time, however, did we feel rushed or under pressure.  The guides were all willing to stop to expand on the history, culture or importance of a particular place if we requested that they do so.  Every guide was willing to stop to let us take photographs and at least 2 of the guides actually helped us get the best pictures we could, given the light and the subject.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The trip to Agua Calientes and Machu Picchu was memorable and we were amazed at how wonderful the train ride was; we both agreed that the train trip was worth the price of the entire trip.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We cannot praise Peru For Less enough and Kelly Chrystal in particular for enabling us to enjoy a short but unforgettable vacation.  We wholeheartedly recommend Peru For Less. </p>\r\n','Marcia and Jim <br/>\r\nNY, USA\r\nCusco &amp; Machu Picchu \r\n','','','',414,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(788,1,'Dear Peruforless,','<p>We really, really enjoyed our trip!

After our stay in Miraflores and exploring Lima, our journey began to see Peru in its most awesome form.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I must say that having Peru For Less organize our travel was the best thing we did as on arrival at the airports there was always a contact there to let us know what was happening, whether it was by car or plane the same process was followed.  Also the pick-ups were clockwork, always on time.  The hotels were spot-on with great breakfasts and lots to choose from on the dinner menu, although you don\'t want to order soup and a main course, it\'s just too much!</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>Upon arrival in Puno, we were greeted by our guide who was with us the entire time we were there.  He made suggestions to keep the altitude problem to a minimum, lots of coca tea, which I continuously drank. It may have helped but I didn\'t notice!  However, we took the two hour boat ride to Isla Taquile and enjoyed our tour there.  While on the island, the sun came out and the scenery was magnificent. The hike to the top was a little challenging but everyone got there.  We had a wonderful lunch and heard a bit about the history which was quite interesting.  We then went to Isla Uros where we saw the reed islands and the boats were Kon Tiki - style, made of reeds. It was quite a day.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got to Cusco two days later and our representative was waiting for us at the airport.  Edgar, what an amazing gentleman, teaches history and architecture, and our two days with him was a lesson on Peru and its history, totally enjoyable.  Cusco is a wonderful city and the cathedral in particular was impressive. Having our private guide made it so much more interesting.  The next day, we left Cusco for the Sacred Valley and the scenery was phenomenal, but that\'s everywhere in Peru.  We visited the Pisac market and the Ollantaytambo fortress and got another history lesson on how the Incas managed to move the rocks up the mountains to assemble them with such accuracy.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our last full day finally took us to Machu Picchu.  Even the train ride to Aguas Calientes was quite enthralling with the river at its highest.  Machu Picchu is, to say the least, an amazing place. It leaves one in awe of the magnitude of the Incas and how they managed nature. We should take some lessons from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had one incident after our Machu Picchu trip, when the train was very late getting us back to Ollantaytambo, and when we arrived, no one was there to take us back to our hotel. But we called our main contact and she organized a pick up for us at 11 o\'clock at night. As I said, there was always someone we could call on for assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks Peru For Less, it was a wonderful adventure.</p>\r\n','Derek &amp; Yvonne <br />\r\nToronto, Canada<br/>\r\nPuno, Cusco, Sacred Valley &amp; Machu Picchu <br/>\r\n','','','',741,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(808,1,'Jennie,','<p>Our trip to Peru was fantastic.

I just wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed it and to thank you for all you did to arrange such a great vacation!  Everything went according to plan and it was wonderful to not have to worry about anything.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We all really enjoyed Vicky, our tour guide in Quito.  She was great!  Right from the beginning when she was waiting for Craig and me at the airport she took wonderful care of us.  She got us checked in at the hotel and arranged to pick us up for our tours. Each day she was on time and was very patient with our group.  I think sometimes it must have been a bit like \"herding cats\" to keep us all together and moving!  And I know we must have exceeded the timing of the tours, but she was always very patient with us.  We were fortunate to take our tour of the city center on Monday when there was the changing of the guards and she positioned us perfectly to get the best view and take the best photos.  In fact, throughout our time with her she became our photographer and took tons of photos of us in front of all the vistas, so we can prove we really were there!!  Since we were there to have a spanish immersion experience she spoke only Spanish to us and did it slowly enough so we were all able to follow her.  She gave clear descriptions of what we were seeing and had a great knowledge of the area.  But, she did not talk TOO much....that can be as bad as saying too little!!  We were so glad to have her along when we needed to fly from Quito to the Galapagos, that would have been a confusing dash through the airport on our own but she got it all arranged for us so it was very easy.  And here\'s an example of how wonderful she was, she went and visited John (he broke his ankle) in the hospital several times and was able to give us an update when we came back from the Galapagos.  Oh, that\'s right, she made a point of finding us in the airport because she knew we were going to waiting for our flights back to the US and told us about John and gave us chocolates.....what a sweet person!</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The two drivers were excellent (Enrique and Javier) and drove very safely.   We spent more time with Javier so got to know him better but they both were very friendly and helpful.  Javier led us on a wonderful hike up the volcano and he was very careful and encouraging with us on that hike (we were all huffing and puffing!)  We were breathless but had a lot of fun!</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Hotel Mercure was excellent!!  Somehow we got suites so my rooms were wonderful!!  The breakfast buffet was delicious every morning.. I miss the chocolate croissants!  It was also nice to have the opportunity to try some Ecuadorian specialties each morning.  The staff of the hotel and restaurant were very helpful, polite and always available.  I felt very safe and very well taken care of.  It was also nice that the hotel had computers we could use.  Definitely a great place to stay and a very inexpensive taxi ride to the district with all the restaurants.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Our Galapagos tour was also wonderful.  Except for us and our luggage getting absolutely drenched while taking the shuttle boat to Santa Cruz everything with all of our connections worked out great!  The Guantanamera was a good ship and our guide, Marvy, had a lot of energy and gave us a lot of fun tours.  He also spoke both in English and Spanish.  The food on the boat was delicious and they kept us well fed. After the two-room suite at the Hotel Mercure the cabins were of course quite small, but the bathroom and shower were surprisingly spacious.  And since we didn\'t spend much time in the cabins it wasn\'t important. I was glad our cabins were on the main deck, especially the last night when my motion sickness patch seemed to lose its effectiveness!  (I\'ve decided it was a 56 hour patch not a 72 hour patch!!)  The boat had a nice amount of space for relaxing compared with some boats we saw.  It was really nice to have only 14 people on the boat and on our tours.  I will say I was very glad we were not cruising around when the Tsunami was on the way!</p>\r\n \r\n<p>So, again, we had a great time!  Thanks so much for all your work setting up such a fun trip.

I didn\'t really know what to expect having never gone through an agency before when traveling, but after a couple months of email consultations, I was able to come up with an awesome itinerary at a reasonable rate. Our advisor made some valuable suggestions and, with a little of my own research, we developed the plan together. I especially liked how the website was organized for choosing hotels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the trip itself, there were so many memories to love. We started in Cusco, where I advise anyone to spend a couple days to acclimate if they\'re going to do the Inca Trail.  Our greeter at the Cusco airport was lovely and she really made us feel welcome. Not only did she answer almost every question we had, but she pointed us in the right direction for the questions she couldn\'t answer herself. I also recommend staying at Hotel Aranwa in Cusco if you want affordable luxury for a couple nights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were hooked up with Wayki Trek for the hike to Machu Picchu and they were beyond all expectations! Our guide was magnificent, our group was small (only 4 of us in total), and we were all so impressed with the porters and cooks. Of course the trail was unbelievable, and not nearly as difficult as I expected. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then went to Puno and toured Lake Titicaca, which was fascinating, especially the floating islands of Uros. The main part of Bolivia that I highly recommend is the Salt Flats of Uyuni. It\'s like being on another planet. We spent two days driving on and around the flats in a four runner with a guide and a driver. We couldn\'t complete the third day of the tour to the Laguna Colorada because of bad weather, but the agency and local tour group worked out a flawless change of plans and even gave us a refund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, we were very impressed and always felt like there was someone looking out for us on the trip. All the drivers and guides were on time and very helpful. Only very minor issues came about which were mostly not the fault of Peru For Less. We kept in email contact with them throughout the trip as needed, and I couldn\'t recommend them more if you\'re planning a trip to Peru or Bolivia. Take the time to develop your itinerary carefully and you\'ll be very pleased with the experience!</p>\r\n','(New Orleans, USA)<br/>\r\nTraveled to: Lima, Cusco, Inca Trail/Machu Picchu, Sacred Valley, Puno, La Paz, Uyuni/Salt Flats\r\n','','','',100017,0,0,NULL,'2014-09-10 22:55:10',NULL),(957,1,'Hi Kelly,','<p>I thought it was a great trip.

We chose Peru For Less because we got the best prices and fastest responses from our advisor Staci. She was so helpful with our planning. The best part about going with a tour/travel company is the support you get while you are on your vacation. We had some bumps in the road at the beginning of our vacation and Peru For Less took care of all of it for us! We were so thankful we had them to help us! </p>  \r\n\r\n<p>We planned 3 different areas to visit while we were in Peru. First, we went to Iquitos, Peru, to get our Amazon River experience.  We booked a 3 day trip with Amazon Explorama Lodges. We had a wonderful time in the Amazon and our guide Lucio was great! We stayed 1 night at ACT\'s Field Station and 1 night at ExploNapo Lodge. We went on the canopy walkway, went fishing on the Amazon, went looking for wildlife, and visited a Shaman. It was a wonderful experience! See below for a picture of us on the Canopy Walkway looking out for miles at the Amazon Rainforest! It was so peaceful and beautiful!   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then flew to Cusco and spent a few days up in the mountains! We took the train to see Machu Picchu. We did a 2-day hike to Machu Picchu with Wayki Trek. We had such a great experience on this hike. We didn\'t have enough time in our itinerary to do the 4-day hike so we decided to do the 2-day hike. We got off the train at KM 104 and started hiking through the Andes. We had an awesome guide, Antonio, who made our experience even better! We would highly recommend doing the 2-day hike to Machu Picchu if you can\'t or don\'t want to do the 4 day Inca Trail hike. You still get to experience seeing Machu Picchu for the first time through the Sun Gate just like the Incas did! It was amazing! We then got to spend the next day exploring Machu Picchu! We also spent one night in Ollantaytambo. We stayed at El Albergue Bed & Breakfast right in the train station. We enjoyed our day exploring Ollantaytambo and the bed and breakfast was a beautiful little place! We highly recommend staying here if you are staying in Ollantaytambo.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third and last part of our trip was to visit Puno and experience Lake Titicaca. We took a tour bus from Cusco to Puno and got to see a lot of towns, ruins, and history. Once we arrived to Puno, we enjoyed the city in the evening. The next day we booked a Lake Titicaca home stay on Amantani Island.  We started our day visiting the Floating Islands then took a boat to Amantani Island. We also had a wonderful tour guide, Joni, who was with us the entire two days! He grew up on Amantani Island and we had the pleasure of staying with his family once we arrived to the Island. We had home-cooked meals with his family and felt their way of living. We were going to hike up to the top of the Island to watch the sunset but unfortunately I started getting a terrible headache and was bedridden all night long. His family was so supportive and went out of their way to find me oxygen and medicine to make me feel better! I also got to try some home remedies like drinking Coca Tea and placing tea leaves on my forehead to help relieve the headache! They went scurrying all over the island to find ways to help me feel better and for that I will be forever grateful! It could have been altitude sickness or just a severe headache, but either way, they were wonderful to me! Being sick on an island with a hospital that was closed for the night was quite the experience! Being a nurse myself didn\'t help the situation either! I knew what I needed and couldn\'t get it! How frustrating! The next day after feeling 100% better, we went to Taquille Island and had lunch then rode back on the boat to Puno. We spent another night in Puno and then headed back to Lima to end our trip!  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would highly recommend Peru For Less. At each new journey there was a Peru For Less representative there to greet us and put our minds at ease with answering any questions we had and giving us the needed forms/tickets.  Thank you, Peru For Less, for making our Peru adventure amazing!  A special thanks to Staci for spending so much time helping us plan our trip. She wrote up 8 itineraries for us because we couldn\'t make up our minds on what we wanted to do within our budget! She was so helpful! What an experience!

The food was incredible; I am a vegetarian and felt taken care of at every meal. </p>\r\n<p>Our stay in Cusco was well planned.

The service and attention to detail was faultless. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact I was given free travel insurance and that the cost of the newly introduced ticket to Huayna Picchu plus an unexplained conversion charge was absorbed by the company makes it even more remarkable. I have already recommended the company to other travelers I met and would not hesitate to do so again. Their prices are also very competitive compared to the same trip booked from the UK. </p>\r\n','Linda (West Sussex, UK)<br/>\r\nTraveled to: Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, Puno, Colca Canyon, Arequipa, Nazca & Paracas\r\n','','','',418,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1011,1,'Hello Kelly,','<p>Just a quick note to say thank you for the wonderful vacation/adventure.

Arriving in a city and not knowing the lay of the land, not knowing where your hotel is or how to get there can be really frustrating. But with Peru For Less, we were met on time, every time, by a local host and our driver who made the transitions incredibly smooth. Besides, it\'s pretty neat to get off the plane and have someone holding a welcome sign with your name on it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also provide knowledgeable and interesting guides who shared not only copious information but also the spirit of their homeland. Our agent, Mari-Ellena was great. Anytime we needed to alter our itinerary or ask a question, Peru For Less was just a quick phone call away at any time. They are all fun people to work with. We loved our trip and are grateful for Peru For Less expert assistance. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out Hollyâ??s review on TripAdvisor. </p>\r\n','Holly (California, USA)<br/>\r\nTraveled to: Lima, Arequipa, Puno, Cusco, Machu Picchu & Puerto Maldonado\r\n','','','',418,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1013,1,'Hi Mari,','<p>Machu Picchu is an experience that I never thought I would actually have. It took my breath away and brought tears to my eyes. And that\'s not from the climbing either!!! It\'s so awesome. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our 17-day Peru adventure would have been very perplexing if it were not for the expert planning of Peru For Less. Our lodging, transportation, transfers, guides, drivers, and all matters were handled seamlessly by Peru ForLess. I have no idea how we could have done it without them. You determine your trip, type of hotel, itinerary, abilities, etc, and they do the hard part of booking and scheduling. And the cost seems to be very reasonable too. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Aguas Calientes, we stayed at the Andina Luxury Hotel overlooking the Urabamba River. The rushing river was a spectacular counterpoint to the meditative stillness of Machu Pittchu. Definitely request a river room. Peru For Less had already done this for us. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I agree with another reviewer that Machu Picchu is a lovely place to end your vacation. Anything else pales by comparison. As far as other places, we really enjoyed Cusco. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out Candiceâ??s review on TripAdvisor. </p>\r\n','Candice (California, USA)<br/>\r\nTraveled to: Lima, Arequipa, Puno, Cusco, Machu Picchu & Puerto Maldonado\r\n','','','',418,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1014,1,'Hi Jennie,','<p>I was very happy about 99% of the trip.

Your flexibility and sometimes the last minute re-scheduling were terrific and much appreciated.  For example, Edgar was a gift!  We had most interesting discussions all day long!  The climb to Huayna Picchu will stay forever in our memory and it may not have happened without the last moment tickets which you sent to us! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)  All the guides we had were very knowledgeable and extremely enthusiastic. They made our experience very personal, we never felt forgotten in a group. The largest group we had had only seven people (with three of us included).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)  Food was good everywhere we went. Your recommendation, Tanto, put us on a good path. We ate a lot, Peruvian specialties whenever possible, but we actually lost weight (due to lots of walking and lots of Quinoa, a very healthy grain). Not bad. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>4)  All hotels were terrific (with rivers of coca tea), clean and quiet. Michael was particularly happy with the Casa de San Blas in Cusco. His other impressions of the last week are still unknown to us but in general he was - just like us - very positively impressed with the entire trip. The Colca lodge, with hot springs, was a pleasant surprise for us. It has the atmosphere of a ski lodge with the smell of wood burning fireplaces, but - of course, there is no snow. We truly enjoyed the hot springs till late in the night.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>5)  We were lucky with the weather, and we saw almost all what was planned and then some.  Unfortunately we did not see condors, but we saw some impressive hawks and eagles. The rain forest was full of life, and the programs for visitors had a rich agenda - with bird watching starting at 5 am, and evening walks after dinner, with a flush light. Beautiful.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>6)  In general we feel stronger and better after the trip than we felt prior to the trip. So much for high altitude and rigorous climbing! It was all good exercise.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you, Aleks, for this marvelous experience!
